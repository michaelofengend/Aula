incoming freshman (l&s undeclared) --> eng?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1co6x1c/incoming_freshman_ls_undeclared_eng/,2024-05-09 13:20:18,"so i was admitted this year for l&s undeclared (with a desire to maybe major in math/physics), but I realized i may be interested in engineering (mechanical or material science) after all. is it possible to transfer to coe from l&s for these majors? i'm super scared i'll be locked in for l&s when i'm not entirely sure if i want to do physical sciences after all","It’s possible. Here’s the website: https://engineering.berkeley.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/change-of-college/. It’s hard but no one knows how hard. You can’t get engineering advising or participate in some events until you’re accepted in sophomore year. I feel like if you get good grades and pursue engineering outside of school (do projects, talk to people idk) and you have a good story about why you didn’t apply to coe freshman year you could probably get in but I have no idea
good luck with that
At least they didn't suddenly get interested in CS lol
no.not possible
pretty sure it is possible"
New eng student: Mistake not to  have taken AP test(s)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1c0wk12/new_eng_student_mistake_not_to_have_taken_ap_tests/,2024-04-10 14:04:46,"My son is a new CEE admit. His school replaced APs with “honors” classes 10 years ago (still rigorous but not oriented to the AP test), so he won’t be coming in with AP credits. He just realized that other kids from his school planning to study engineering signed up to take the AP tests for Calc AP and Physics. He is regretting that he didn’t know to do this (and his school doesn’t particularly encourage it).

My thinking is that, yes, it may allow him to skip these courses - but it also isn’t the worst thing in the world to start his freshman year with some comfortable subject matter (and presumably there will be new or more challenging aspects).  

Curious to hear any opinions on this from current / recent eng students!","Being able to skip many lower division courses with AP give you a huge head start and save you both time and money. You can graduate early and save a lot of tuition, especially if you are out-of-state.

Also, there isn't a point to re-learn, for example, calculus when you already know how to do them. The point here is that knowing calculus and getting good grades from a calculus class is different. If you have AP to skip calculus classes, you essentially can eliminate the risk of getting anything less than A from the class. There are also courses like Chemistry that probably isn't super relavant to what you are interested in, and probably won't come up again either. Skipping it with AP chem just solves this issue.

Also also, taking 'comfortable' classes might make college more boring tha it should be. Yes you have time outside of class, but you will spend 1 year learning stuff you already know instead of some exciting new topics.

For reference, I came in with ~60 AP credits, which made a 4 year MechE degree doable in around 2.5 years. Now I have the freedom to choose to do a second major or graduate early, which won't be possible without all the AP credits I got.
It’s not the worst thing in the world. He’ll just have to take more classes, and graduating early is probably out of the question. The extra classes could be good for GPA boosters, though some classes, particularly Math 1B, the second Calc class, are known to be major weeders.
I would say it's not too big of an issue if it's just AP Calc and AP Physics he was wanting to take. A 5 in AP Physics C - Mechanics can cover for Physics 7A, but all other physics tests (AP Physics 1, 2, C-EM) can't cover for the physics requirements in CoE. It would be a bummer if he was preparing for AP Physics C-mechanics, but otherwise, that AP test would not make a difference in his academic plan.

AP Calc AB and BC are definitely useful for skipping out of Math 1A/1B. But Math 1B covers more than AP Calc BC (like differential equations that have applications in physics and solid mechanics), so it definitely won't be a boring class even with prior calculus knowledge.

If he wants, he could probably get easy community college credit this summer to skip out of Math 1A, Physics 7A, and maybe the R1A or chemistry requirement. Otherwise, it would just be half of one semester that is taken up with those classes
I got credit for 8 AP tests when I went to Berkeley. Gave me around 30 credits and let me skip a whole year. Well worth it to save that money.
Too late now. The nice thing about AP classes is you can just take the class again in college if you really want.
Nice! Thanks for your reply. Unfortunately I don’t think he has any option to take the AP test now (he’ll start college in the fall and the May test sign up deadline was apparently in November). So just trying to understand how bad it is for him! (Luckily we are in-state so that takes some pressure off timeline / budget-wise)
What about gen eds?
I say coming in with 0 APs puts him quite behind, but taking classes he already understand also gives him more times outside of class. He can either take more classes in a semester or do labs / clubs / personal projects outside of class, depending on how ambitious he is. Just for a point of reference."
do College of Eng students have to fulfill the L&S breadths?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14xexib/do_college_of_eng_students_have_to_fulfill_the_ls/,2023-07-11 22:22:44,i went thru the graduate req. and i saw that there wasn't a l&s breadth things listed... I'm an eecs major so i was kinda confused in planning my schedule ,"You have H/SS courses instead.  You need to take 6 of them, of which at least 1 of the classes is a R&C B course.  Your other classes can come from classes that satisfy the 5 breadths outside of Physical or Biological Sciences.  2 of the courses must be Upper Division.  You can use up to 2 AP classes, eg AP Psych, to fulfill your H/SS classes.
OK THANK YOU 😝😝 also, when classes have letters next to the numbers… like what do they mean (ex. 111AC) like does it stand for American cultures or something else
Ok sorry to ask again, but would I have to satisfy the 5 breadths with the 6 courses or do they just have to be valid classes that would’ve satisfied them?
Yep, AC is for American Cultures.  But strangely enough, not all classes that are AC eligible are marked as AC.  For example, HIST 7A. Best to use the American Cultures filter in the Academic Guide.
https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/coci-handbook/2.2.5 for the other prefixes/suffix
You have to satisfy the 6 H/SS courses.  The only rules are that at least one is an R&C course (you have to have both but you might have passed one already., you didn’t tell me what you can skip), and 2 have to be upper division.  The other 3 can come from breadths or HS-eligible classes.
ok ily
You’re so amazing for this"

Can second that Liepmann is awesome. He has this sort of deadpan humor about him and does definitely ramble, but in a way that (I personally think) is really entertaining - it feels like you’re sitting in on a casual conversation and listening to him tell stories. Granted, this is not for everyone, but I find that the breadth and real-world relatability of his seemingly random thoughts relate well to his material.
The waitlist for the class is already full, should I keep my phase 1 limit?

I GOT IN,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bqausd/i_got_in/,2024-03-28 16:59:46,"GUYS THIS IS ABSOLUTELY ASTRONOMICALLY INSANE. I got into UCB with College of Eng - Engineering (Undeclared).

I’m in state and I live like 45 min away from berk so I might commute idk yet

But one thing I wanna say to the future class or just anyone who’s been getting a lot of college rejections:

I got rejected from every college I applied to except 2.. including getting rejected from UCSD, UCD, UCLA. There’s ALWAYS another path to get to your goals. 

And as a side note, don’t look down on CC. Everyone that I know did CC got into UCD, UCLA, UCB for their intended major and I’ve not heard ONE bad thing about doing the transfer route. Everyone and their moms need to know how much potential CC route has, and know that any college you go to, what matters more is what u get done there. 

Gob ears. ","Good shit, welcome and gob ears!
Welcome to Berkeley and go bears!! You are going to have the best four years here. Sorry this subreddit is overwhelmingly negative but you will find it doesn’t represent most students actual experiences on campus 
DO NOT COMMUTE!!!!  Live in the dorms Freshmen year and make some fucking friends. Get drunk at least once. Get out. Make some damn friends. Hang out around campus and meet folks. Don't be a fucking drone and then post here in 4 years about how you wasted your time in college and hate yourself.
congrats and welcome! if you have the means to do so, PLEASE DO NOT COMMUTE i beg. the experiences and connections you’ll make here are invaluable. you need to orient yourself in the best position to soak up as much opportunity as you can here. 

take ur studies seriously but do go out. try as many things as you possibly can. as a freshman you can lowkey throw your first sem away just being a degen and still claw it all back if you lock in junior and senior year. this is not me advising you to abuse hard drugs. i’m saying it’s the one period of your life where you arguably have the least responsibilities to most freedom, so take full advantage of it.

go try that hobby, go make those plans, go chase that cute classmate. seize these days, bc it’ll pass by you before you know it.
Same, I got rejected from the three other UCs I applied to (UCSB, UCSD, UCLA) then just got accepted to EECS.
If you are a bear now you need to address the university properly. ""UCB"" is explicitly not allowed, as per the style guide. It is either Cal or UC Berkeley. I think Cal Berkeley is allowed in conversation.
First, don’t say UCB.  Second, CONGRATULATIONS!!🥳🎊🎉🎈👏
Congrats!! Also, a tip from the class of '85, never again refer to Cal as UCB.
Congrats !!! Definitely should celebrate 🎉
Welcome 🐻
Great job bud
i live 45 mins away too and did cc route woo woo congrats! barting back and forth is definitely cheaper, but i live on campus mon-fri and go back home on weekends. it makes life convenient if u live close to school if u have that option :D
Engineering Undeclared is one of the harder majors to get accepted with. Well done! Gob Ears!
Welcome to Cal! My advice:
* Live in the dorms for at least one year, maybe two
* Take an easy load your first term. This will make it easier to get used to college life. (I took 13 units)
* Study super hard at least your first three weeks. Your first midterm will set your first GPA. Your first term GPA will set your overall GPA. Do well while everyone else is screwing off. 
* Make friends fast. They will likely be the ones that you stick with for your four years. 
* Explore relationships as well. You will learn what you like and don’t like in a partner while you’re in college. 
* Get an internship during your first summer break. You will be way ahead of everyone else. 
* AND if you play an instrument join Cal Band. They are absolutely the most spirited group on campus. AND go to every football game! 
Go Bears!!!
Ok
Good for you!!
Aye congratulations!
CONGRATS BABY GOB EARS 🐻🐻🐻!!!
welcome!
bro can i actually live with you i genuinely can't afford housing for UCB
Bro do civil engineering. You can pursue anything you want with it
Slightly off topic but IMO you shouldn’t commute. You should live in the dorms and enjoy that as part of your freshman experience. Could help a lot with making some friends during the start of the year.
It’s truly not the worst if you have to commute. But you might want to do the dorms a year then see about the future. You can be less stressed about finding an apt if commuting is always an option. But Berkeley is pretty darn different from anywhere in a 45 min radius so it’s really good to have the full experience.
Congrats!

Live in the dorms and figure out how to talk to girls .  I don’t want to see any more cringe posts bombarding this sub.
Hang on, I thought the admissions doesn't come out till end of April. What gives?
I was a transfer student to UC Berkeley once upon a time. No regrets, saved tons of money and left Undergrad with no debt. Missed out on some social stuff first few years which was hard, but hey.
NIIIIIICE
Commuting sucks as everyone else is saying. You might as well just not be at Berkeley. Don’t do it. College is about living on college. You will genuinely miss out on 80% of the benefits college gives in the first place
This is fantastic advice. You’re wise! Congratulations.
If you commute you will have spent 32 days continuously driving to/from school over 4 years. 

That’s a lot of time in your life not well spent.
Do not commute😭 I live in the east bay also like 40 min away from Berkeley and commuted one summer and it was absolutely miserable.
Congratulations!! Learn from my mistakes and don’t dorm in foothill and join some kind of club or student org to increase your odds of making friends. Also don’t be too hard on yourself. If you fail a midterm or class its not the end of the world. You’re hella young and have so much time to get where you want to be
I wish more people knew and took advantage of this. CC in California especially is a phenomenal opportunity.
What r y’all’s thoughts on commuting Vs living on campus? I’ve heard the housing isn’t that goood
Why tell us about CCC? Do that in a2c.

Congrats, though.
Its not that deep lil bro

YOO thank you!! It’s been a ride
There are so many suicides on this campus, just like any other top schools but there was so many just last semester that the co ops were publishing about…. And many more unheard. 
not to diminish this persons amazing accomplishment, but yea there are so shitty things happening on this campus that need to be addressed point blank period
Hear, hear!
I had a friend that did that and flunked out. In moderation guys.
Agreed!
When I got UCD rejection I thought I was cooked
LMFAO k my b
UC CAL, or UCC is preferred
LMAOOO THANKSS
MY BAD BRO IVE BEEN COOKED IN THIS SUBREDDIT ABT THIS ALREADY
do u rlly feel like ur missing out on college life by commuting? do u think u still were able to get involved in things u were interested in even tho u don’t live on campus?
Thank u!
Thanks! Do u have any tips on how to secure an internship during summer of freshmen yr?
LMAO real
I AM A GIRL.
Surprise! You didn’t mark your calendar right! All California public’s are out!
That’s for transfers
I know sometimes you don't have a choice, but if you are able you should really do everything you can to live on campus. Half of college IMO are the amazing experiences you are able to make, which are very difficult to participate in if you have to commute (i.e late night hangouts, library grinds, dorm floor activities)
I had godawful roommates (SO BAD!) and I would still wholeheartedly recommend living on campus if you can. It’s a good bridge between home > independent living and it’s definitely part of the college experience. Get good earplugs and shower shoes for sure though 😂
If you can and want to really experience everything live on campus. However, I commute about 45 minutes without traffic.  I have no issues.
I would really suggest living on campus if possible for the first year or two at least. Really really important to find your own community and friends here. Commuting can and will be lonely when you are trying to make friends. But by junior and senior year commuting can help you save a lot of money while you already have friends, clubs, and communities that you are a part of. A lot of the people I know who commuted from the beginning didn’t love their experience at Cal in the same way.
What a dick. Perhaps it's coz the demographic you wish was better protected is too good for CC?? The reason they accept transfers is because so many drop out by then - that's all UC's not just ""cal"".
gob ears!
Maybe make your own post instead of ruining his celebration?
Are you a troll?
[deleted]
Did what? Make a friend? Or got drunk?  Neither will cause you to drop out. Obviously booze can cause serious problems, but I know plenty of Cal grads that have drank and drugged their way though (not that I recommend that).
Oh no! One out of like 15k undergrads every year?!
My son got into Berkeley today.  He also got rejected by UCD, and we were wondering WTF, and what would that mean for the rest.  He also got into UCSB, but waitlisted at UCSD and UCI, and rejected by UCLA.  Definitely a mixed bag.  I wonder what could be the explanation.
Bro I got rejected from UC Merced (has a very high acceptance rate), imagine how I felt
No problem ;) and congrats.
[For your reading amusement.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/s/PY3EUxkJwr)
Okay so when are you leaving for home? 5pm? 8pm? 10pm? 1am?

There’s endless things to do and so much studying to be done, I have no idea why you’d spend 1.5 hours a day doing nothing vs doing anything at all!
Yes! It’s all about who you know, not what you know. Everyone tries the front door. You have to find the back door. Here is what I mean. Everyone will try the traditional route of applying online for lots of internships. Some may apply to 100 and get rejected 100 times. You need to find someone who can help you to get that internship. Maybe your parents know if someone. Or one of your high school teachers knows of someone in the industry. Or get to know your professors or teacher assistants. You are looking for that connection who will help you land a position that nobody else knows about.

I’m my case, my sisters boyfriend worked at a high tech company. He got me my first paid internship and I actually worked for him for a summer. I made a ton of money and started building my resume. BTW, I did a great for them and they wanted to hire me after I graduated. But I turned them down and went to graduate school. 

Do you know someone on the industry? Do you know someone who knows someone? Let me know what you think.
Thanks - Dang !
Yeah I mean I’m trying to keep college costs as low as I can so it’s not too much of a financial burden — how much value would I rlly be missing out on? I have my own car that I can take so timing is flexible
What demographic do I wish was better protected? This total non sequitur should be interesting.
HER 🦅
Obviously yes, regardless of their answer.
I haven’t been in contact with him for years, but last I heard he was training to become a firefighter.
Partied too hard and didn’t prioritize his studies. Some can handle freedom some can’t.
Annie, are you ok?
lol Davis trying to up their numbers by rejecting people too qualified
This is proof enough to me that the UCs lie about not communicating. So many people from my high school had the exact same scenario. Accepted to UCSB and Berkeley only
THANK YOU HOMIE
IDK DAWG I JUST GOT IN IM FIGURING IT OUT
Gotchu, yes this was super helpful.
I’m part of this organization that my mom has connections to, when do u think is the right time to start leveraging these connections and securing an internship? I wanna make good money while also studying so I can pay for expenses … wanna reduce that burden from my family as much as I can
Imo you would be missing out on most of the value afforded to you by college during your freshman year by choosing to commute. The people you meet / connections you make and time you spend with them is far more valuable *during your first year* than gen ed / intro classes where hundreds to thousands of people take them simultaneously & the professors themselves are largely inaccessible.

I still think that it is valuable to live near campus for at least another year if not all four, but I definitely see the case for commuting after your first year (and especially after your first two) to cut down on costs.
Sorry! Your celebration!!!
Exactly, don’t commute. 

Have you ever commuted to that extent before?

Basically the party or whatever will be just getting going and you’ll be “whelp I gotta go or else”. 

Also you’ll be driving while tired a lot.
I’m glad this was helpful. Definitely start now in getting to know people in your Mom’s network. Now is the right time to start lining things up even if it for next summer. 

You may can start making money by working this summer. My advice would be to wait on tables if you can. You will learn so many interpersonal and sales skills from this because you will need to speak up and be social to earn those tips. 

When you get your internship though you may not make any money, but you will gain lots of experience.  That is most important now for your future career when you can make BIG money. 

Again, hope this helps and please ask more questions if you have them.
Thanks for the advice, super appreciate it. I reached out to some of my mom’s connections and they said they’re not currently looking for any interns , or they hire only juniors / seniors — do you have any advice on how I can my foot through the door? I wanna get some experience the summer before my freshmen year as well"

Im just thinking if it’s worth doing it during the summer since I know Berkeley has a good Eng department so it might be helpful idk. I’m a cogsci major if that matters ,"I took r1a and r1b requirements at community college over summers and have 0 regrets. Time at Berkeley is too valuable to spend writing (pointless) essays
It depends if you’re good at writing or not.  If you’re good at it, why pay for a class and not get a grade to boost your GPA?
If it works the best with your schedule and four-year plan, then take it at a CC. I personally prefer Berkeley because at Berkeley, you can taken your R&C requirements in sooooo many departments and not just English, and even in each department the choices for topics and readings are literally endless because every section has a different topic and is in essence a different class. At a CC all you get is English and nothing else. There may be slight difference in topic, but they're all English. You don't get choices to do R&C in subjects like comp lit, classics, anthropology, etc. My R&C class literally changed my life and inspired me into my major.
It will probably be easier to get a higher grade at CC
thanks for your input! Might I ask what you mean by the different departments that I can fulfill the Eng requirements ? Cuz I thought for English GEs I need to take the freshman Eng class r&c a and r&c b? Is there different variations to choose from?
Also I’m not that good at English since I never rlly had a good Eng teacher 😭 so are Eng classes at Berkeley hard? How’s the workload?
If you scroll down this link (actually make sure to scroll inside the box as there's a separate scroll wheel that you may not notice upon first glance), it will give you a list of classes that satisfy R&C requirements. There are thirty-something departments apart from English that offer R&C classes.

[https://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/letters-science/reading-composition-requirement/#RC](https://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/letters-science/reading-composition-requirement/#RC)

Of course, as I said, individual sections have different topics even within the same department, so the department and course number only give you a general sense of the direction, but not the actual topic.

The only exception is if you haven't satisfied entry-level writing (which most people have upon entering), in which case you'd need to take College Writing R1A to fulfill both entry-level writing and R&C A in a single class. But if you have entry level writing out of the way, you can take any R&C class you want.
Oh that makes a lot more sense now. Thanks!"
Currently in engineering (undeclared)— choosing between L&S CS and EECS,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bsyh55/currently_in_engineering_undeclared_choosing/,2024-04-01 01:44:20,"Got accepted into the CoE as eng undeclared as a HS senior— but I have intentions of studying CS right off the bat.

Friends were telling me that’s it’s much easier to switch from CoE to L&S , but harder to go back if I end up changing my mind.

That’s why I’m trying to figure out the pros and cons with CS and EECS. Not interested in EE tbh, but also wondering if the CS Curriculum is diff/better/worst in EECS vs L&S CS.

","You don’t need any EE besides EECS16A/B.
How's your math and physics? If your suck at either, go with L&S CS. With EECS, you have to take Math 53/54, and Physics 7A/7B. Neither are cakewalks, whereas for L&S you can even test out of Math 1A/1B with your AP tests (I think)
CS is in CDSS, not L&S
Go to EECS. More hype and more prestige and u only need two classes extra.

EECS is honestly just a glorified CS major for most people. Most people just take EECS 16A and B and stop taking EE classes after that
Yeah I got 5’s on both my Calc BC and AP Physics C exams, but I heard that for EECS u need to take more gen Ed classes ? (Like history, eng, etc) compared to L&S CS

Tbh I’m not interested in taking so many classes unrelated to my major. Also is there rlly a diff between CS and EECS when looking for internships/ job opps? Just tryna understand the full picture when it comes to these two
If I want to do a focus in AI and a more project-leaning approach what do u recommend ?
Unless something changed, I think it's the other way around. L&S requires a bunch of general breadth courses that COE doesn't.
You end up taking the same CS courses, so it doesn't matter which one.
So would u recommend EECS then?"
Civil Engineering - Cal vs SLO,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bqfxxr/civil_engineering_cal_vs_slo/,2024-03-28 21:02:06,"Son is fortunate to have both options. He’s interested in Civil Engineering (and also architecture, which he could dabble in at SLO as a minor but not at Cal).

He likes hands-on work, with teams and a collaborative environment. He probably would prefer the more urban, diverse vibe of Cal (we live in SF). And of course hard to turn down the opportunity to attend Cal, in any event.

Question I have is: does the civil eng major at Cal involve a decent amount of team work, hands on projects etc? Or is it super traditional and theoretical? Is the student culture collaborative or cutthroat?  Other things we should be thinking about? (He’s other option is UIUC, which is also great for civil, but we don’t know much about it yet…)

Thank you!","Can’t speak to the specific course structure for CivE at Cal, but I do know that it is ranked #1 in the country. 

I chose Cal over SLO, and I do not ever regret that decision in the slightest.
Hands down. Cal
As a recent civil grad, there are so many opportunities to get hands on experience outside of the classroom. Almost everyone was super kind and collaborative. Cal poly is a great school but theres a reason why berkeley has the #1 civil engineering program in the nation.
Cal Poly student here with my surface level analysis.

**Strengths of Cal Poly**: Learn by doing means lots of hands on experience. From what I hear, most UC students take two years of GEs and only after get to start enrolling in major-related coursework. At Cal Poly, freshmen are immediately enrolled in major-related coursework, you can see the [flowchart for CE here.](http://flowcharts.calpoly.edu/) Edit: also, freshmen are blocked into their required courses so they don't need to worry about registration and fighting for labs and lectures.

Being a primarily undergraduate institution, the class sizes are smaller - for major-related courses it might only be 20 or 30 - so the professor is able to pay closer attention to every student and does most of the teaching, compared to UCs where [a lot of the classes are taught partially by GSIs/TAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/CalPoly/comments/tianfp/civil_engineering_at_cal_poly/i1iscz5/). Quite a lot of people have internships lined up after junior year and Career Services holds a career fair during the year just for CE majors ([link to the Jan 2024 attending companies](https://cpceenvecareerfair.com/2024-attending-companies)). 

The rigor of the program, especially vocationally, is comparable to Berkeley - our university team has [won the national ASCE Concrete Canoe competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_canoe#Past_winners) seven times in the past twelve competitions. The campus is away from the city so it's extremely safe if that's a factor you're considering, and crime seems to be much lower in SLO than in Berkeley. 

**Weaknesses of Cal Poly**: Less prestige than Berkeley and less research opportunities at Cal Poly. The quarter to semester transition in 2026 might be really messy and is taking away a huge advantage of our school. While Berkeley has about 20+ libraries, our sole library is closed until fall of 2025 for renovations, and their replacement is setting up a [huge white tent in a parking lot with tables inside](https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c639099/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1080+0+0/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff6%2F70%2Fe790f20444b3ad3a130378ecee47%2Fimage00321.jpg). 

I think Cal Poly is the whitest public university in California, so much less diverse. **A lot less** things to do other than go to the beach or hike for the nth time - it can't be understated how little there is to do in SLO compared to the Bay. And SLO is much more car-centric than Berkeley; we have two major highways that cut through the city and both neighbor campus. Food scene is also kinda bad even off-campus, definitely worse than Berkeley. Struggling to find decent Chinese food here. Edit: Also our football team kinda sucks, I think we broke a record for our losing score against SJSU in the fall. It was like 17-51 or something.

Can't really speak much to the academic experience at Berkeley since I don't know but I hope this helped. Both universities are good choices and students mingle from the two quite often; we just had a urban planning trip to Sacramento and went with some people from Berkeley, and we hosted the [ITE transportation summit on campus this year](https://www.ite2024sls.com/) and lots of students from Cal came as well.
Go with cal trust me
Come to Cal! The CivE students were so kind when I went (2017-2021). There’s a BUNCH of competition teams he could join and get hands-on/collaborative work. Could say a lot more, but I loved my experience in the civil engineering department. Message me if you have questions!
Man, I'm a senior in high school in the same exact boat as your son, but for Industrial Engineering. I can't decide between Cal Poly and Berkeley. Cal Poly's hands-on approach, location/weather, legitimate professor-to-student relationships, and early access to major-related courses are all very attractive to me. Meanwhile at Berkeley, I really don't want to end up having these ""Nobel winning professors"" who show up on the first day and then just have their TA teach for the rest of the semester. 

I hear that many employers would rather hire out of Cal Poly because of the student's ability to jump right in and know how to solve problems out the gate. However, I understand that an engineering degree at Berkeley can go a lot farther than an engineering degree at Cal Poly because of better connections and name recognition. Also, Berkeley likely provides better internship/job opportunities because of its location in the Bay. 

For all these reasons, I am completely torn between the two. **Need help.**
i would like to add here that one of my parents is a senior civil engineer in socal and hires a lot of people. MOST of the people she hires are from CPP and CPSLO (and occasionally cal, USC, UCLA, but less of them apply compared to CPP/CPSLO). she says this is because they have very good mechanical skills from attending these hands-on, application-based cal states that you are clearly looking for. but she also says a con is that USC/UCLA/Cal students are better at communicating than CSU students due to the better research experiences there. i'm pretty sure she hires most of the UC/USC students though. this doesn't mean cal isn't amazing obviously, but your son will still be very successful IN CALIFORNIA if he goes to SLO even if it is ""less prestigious."" the case is probably very different outside of the state though, which is a big pro for cal because it is a T10 globally and T15 in the U.S. UIUC is also a top school for engineering nationally. hope this helps lmao
I have graduated from Berkeley MechE in both Bachelor's and Master's, but had the opportunity to take at least one class in just about all engineering fields, including a class in architecture and my observation was CivE was generally the most collaborate environment. It further helps that just about most CivE classes are focused on real-life examples. There certainly will be some rigorous traditional and theoretical curriculum and perhaps a class or two that goes a bit too deep, but there is no doubt that your son will learn the deepest fundamentals and develop a mindset of 'learning how to learn' when he is faced with a challenge.

For hands-on experience, there will be several clubs (https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/student-life/teams-and-organizations/) that prepare a competition for each year, and I can assure the likes of Steel Bridge Club or Cal Concrete Canoe that are mostly by CivE folks will be hands-on.
Hi: Insider Pros of engineering at Cal?. Why do you not regret it?  On the fence here too with Berkeley vs SLO. Thx!
Great post you made.  I went in the late 80’s.  The times article is a good recap of what it was.  I’m not white, and going to Poly didn’t bother me.  I would go again because people are nice, but it’s not for all.  But when you get out, you appreciate more that Poly is very limited in this respect.  The ones who were really cheated are the white kids, in my opinion as they were released into a world that became and is becoming different.  At the time,  you could count the Asians on your hand.  And I knew the black kids by site because there were the same 2-3 I always saw every day, every year.  The Latino students were small but I felt the largest 2nd group. Small but more than a handful. Nonetheless less I loved my time there.  Great profs.  Intimate educational experience that I really feel you can’t get at Cal if that’s your thing.
Back in 1985, the LA Times did a profile of Cal Poly which was quite interesting to read, seeing how a lot of the strengths and concerns still hold true today. The reporter also takes a couple digs at Cal. Take a look: [https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-05-28-mn-16267-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-05-28-mn-16267-story.html)
Hi I’m also deciding between Cal and Cal Poly for Industrial Engineering! I’m leaning towards slo because of the location and hands on approach. How are you deciding?"

RANK upper div probability course you guys recommend taking for data science major? I have the options of stat 134 with Stoyanov, Data C140 with Adhikari, or INDENG 172 with Daniel Pirutinsky…. I would be 88/100 on the waitlist/ near the end of it because there are reserved seats 

 I heard people saying ind eng is better, but the professor this semester has lwk bad rating overall but there’s none specifically on this class so idk how its gonna go with him

other classes this fall
Math 56
R5B w/ Rachel Cook
UGBA 10

 ","Read up on the comparison between the different Probability options -  http://prob140.org/about/

If your goal is to get properly prepared into ML, I would say that 126 or 140 are the ways to go.  If you’re the type that takes the easy way out with classes like CS 88C, Math 16A and the like, IND 172 might be for you.
Nobody says Ind eng is better. EECS126 > DATA140 > nothing matters after that
EECS 126 >= DATA 140 >>>>> everything else. I don't know where people are getting the Ind Eng. classes are better, even for stuff like optimization theory because its in a completely different focus.
IND 172 isn’t very easy. I’d check Berkeleytime grade distributions. Ind Eng kids are smart and the professor is a menace.
Is pirutinsky hard?
Grade distributions are the most ridiculous criteria for determining whether a class is hard or not.  Know what the easiest math class is at Berkeley by far? Stat 2.  Guess what the average GPA is?  Borderline B-. 

The average GPA for EECS 126 is 3.42, and Stat 134 is 2.81.  Data 140 is probably somewhere around 2.9 So that must mean EECS 126 is much easier than the other 2, right?  I think not. 

Grade distributions mean nothing in the world of curved classes. The quality of the student in the classes is much more of a determinant. I can pretty much tell you that 172 will be much easier than the other 3 classes.
When people say “easy” or “hard” they generally mean what grade they get in relation to the amount of work. EECS 126 is the hardest but has EECS kids who work hard and the grading is better. I already thoroughly looked at every prob course’s reviews, grading, reserved seats, and profs. I’d say considering of all of these, it goes 140 > 126 >= 134 or 172 (depending on your career goals, 126 above all for ML, 134 for more chill). 

IND ENG kids are smart too, that’s why I brought it up. It’s not STAT 134 which is a mix of majors. The IND ENG major is a bunch of upper-div math with terrible professors and nonexistent support due to its size, and 172 has the worst grade distribution of all probability courses considering this. 

My point was just that IND ENG 172 isn’t the easiest. I don’t know why you would think it is when considering the variance in majors in 134 and 140."
"Cal Sailing Club apparently facing eviction from Berkeley Marina sailboat dock, by City of Berkeley",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cjddvb/cal_sailing_club_apparently_facing_eviction_from/,2024-05-03 09:48:06,"The Cal Sailing Club apparently has used six slots for its small sailboats at the Berkeley Marina for about 50 years. The Berkeley City Manager has now proposed evicting them so those spaces can be rented to larger private boats for more profit for the City.

I should say that I'm *not* a part of the Cal Sailing Club and not familiar with the details of this particular controversy, but the organization has a good reputation and focuses on providing low cost or free opportunities for sailing on the Bay and teaching people to sail. And they make a compelling case in their petition (see links below). They say they provide 2,500+ people with free rides / sails on the Bay a year, and have 1,100 ""active annual memberships"". They need their specific current location so their small sailboats can *""maneuver in and out of the marina under sail.""*

I should also add that I'm not surprised to see the City wants more money here. This is part of a long term pattern. Key people on the City staff, IMHO, are focused primarily on ""generating revenue"", often undermining or killing popular community activities as a side effect. The popular Berkeley Kite Festival which thousands of people attended every July, and was held adjacent to the Marina in Chavez Park was done away with in this same sort of way, with the City suddenly demanding vastly increased fees for hosting the festival.

The Sailing Club has a petition on [Change.org](http://Change.org), here:

And in the petition there's a link to a letter from the Sailing Club that gives a lot of details about their history, and problems with the City's proposal.","If you live in Berkeley, also recommend contacting your city councilor about this! They're supposed to represent their constituents.
the berkeley city manager has such a history of ruining anything community oriented. fuck them they suck
This is alarming.
Berkeley city council are such ghouls
Worked as a day leader at CSC while I was a student. It is still the best and coolest job I’ve ever had.
This is possibly the most evil thing I've ever heard the city council doing lmao. The Sailing Club helps so many students learn to sail, and they want to kick for them out for rich people yachts? WTF lmfao?

And I guarantee you they wouldn't allow the marina to expand if the marina wanted. They've probably denied construction permits hundreds of times.
I would imagine that a vastly more effective way to engage on this topic would be to get involved with the Waterfront Specific Plan. The actual controversy arises in section 2.3.2 in the draft plan

>The plan at right illustrates the potential for docks D, E, J, L and M to be reconfigured to allow for larger slips. This change reflects market analysis that demonstrates reduced demand in the Bay Area for smaller slips. Adjusting the balance of slips to reflect demand for larger slips is intended to reduce vacancy rates at the Marina and increase berthing revenue.
Everybody Ling Ling!
Get rid of these tit sucking, tax milking, destroy our local traditions and fun folks and elect people who can make a difference.  Berkeley:  Your fault for electing these non-forward thinking people!
This sub suddenly not a fan of market dynamics when the victims aren't poor people in tents. Weird.
If Cal would pay more, I’m sure they wouldn’t get evicted. This is how it works everywhere in the world, sometimes prices go up, and if you don’t pay the prices, you don’t get to keep the service.
Second this. And this November Vote accordingly!
It sounds like the City staff are the culprits in this case. Hopefully the Council will listen to the petition.
Me too
> The Sailing Club helps so many students learn to sail

How many?

I took a paid, community, sailing class with them a few years ago. It was so terrible. The instructor was such a complete asshole.

I don't know that the org deserves to die because I had a bad experience. But I can certainly believe that (like a lot of non-profits!) they're very inefficient, and a poor use of public space.
Non-profits often get reduced rates.
Yeah, but they offer a public service. No one else wants to offer it, or do it more efficiently. So you might as well be calling for that service to never be offered. Maybe that’s fine for leisure stuff but there are a lot of non-profits that provide incredibly invaluable resources.
Not sure why you are being downvoted, this is a good point. I'm not sure how many students / club members they have.
""Public service""? The Cal Sailing Club isn't free, or even close to free.

But they are freeloading on the Cal name and on this land that belongs to the City (and citizens) of Berkeley.

Maybe they provide a worthwhile cost-efficient service to a large number of people, and should continue to exist. Maybe they shouldn't. Let's look at it through data. I object to the kneejerk narrative that government bureaucrats are obviously wrong in every case, no need to examine the merits.

(*) Freeloading -> paying far less than market value
Every weekend there are dozens of people there, and many of them get to go sailing for the first time for very little money
Dude it’s $90 for 3 months of unlimited sail time, they give you gear to borrow and everything. Every Thursday evening they also buy pizza and beers and you are free to eat if you want. With a Berkeley clipper card you can take the 51b down from campus for free. Sure, the folks on the Monday courses are not always the most coherent, but every single instructor is a volunteer, and is paid in food at most.

If you go 2x per week (say Saturday/Monday + Thursday) for 3 months (about one semester) you will come out to about to about 3x4x2 = 24 sessions with at least around 48 sail hours, if not more as well as around 10-12 meals. Moreover, signing up as a member entitles you to the weeklong junior skipper course which is much more intense than the casual sail lessons you get most of the time, provided you can rig your own boat and you do a couple of volunteer hours (when I say a couple, it literally means 2 and you can use that time to learn something useful like bosuning). Moreover, if you log 12 hours of volunteer time, you get a free renewal for your membership.

I get that the members of the club are a bit weird sometimes, but it sounds like you just didn’t want to put in the work of learning the theory by yourself (which literally everyone tells you to do) and are sh*tting on the sailing club because you had a bad experience. It is an incredibly cost effective service and I personally learned how to sail well enough to compete in some serious regattas more recently because of how much freedom I had to do what I wanted in the club. Each of the boats they have is easily $10k-20k or more and most sailing clubs will charge a whole lot more than Cal Sailing does for upkeep and maintenance."

Anyone else being affected by the High Demand Major Policy????,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/163sb6q/anyone_else_being_affected_by_the_high_demand/,2023-08-28 10:30:03,"Subjects include (as of June 1, 2022):

1. Art Practice
2. Global Studies
3. Psychology
4. Computer Science
5. Media Studies
6. Public Health
7. Data Science
8. Operations Research & Management Science
9. Social Welfare
10. Economics
11. Political Economy

What ""they"" say about the policy:

1. You **can** only apply to one HD major
   1. which means you cannot double major in two HD subjects (unless you are already intending to one of them) and you have the risk of not even getting a HD major
2. You can only apply **once with no appeal**
3. comprehensive review: may include a short essay statement(s), transcript(s), resume, and the student’s holistic read score from their UC Berkeley application (isn't this just like Haas???)
4. Unclear: who will be reviewing them, seats available for each major, competitiveness, criteria for assessment

I can confidently say that this is definitely not ""*improv\[ing\] the undergraduate student experience*"". The whole process is very confusing - even L&S hasn't received complete information about it and cannot advise us students on it. I get that these subjects are ""highly demanded"" and faculties are having a hard time meeting these demands. I am fine if we are asked to submit a comprehensive review of these subjects (with no restrictions whatsoever on **how many and the number of times** we can apply to them). But what I don't get is why we can only **apply to one HD major once with no appeal**.

As an undeclared freshman, I feel extremely disadvantaged and even discriminated against by this new policy and believe **that we need to inform Berkeley that we demand a clearer response.**

I am still trying to figure out what the procedure is for a petition/communication with the policy coordinators. **But if you are affected by this policy in any way** or want to show your support against this policy, **please join this discord server:** [**https://discord.gg/JBxDrxCrcJ**](https://discord.gg/JBxDrxCrcJ) It will be great if you can share your thoughts or any information you've received up there. I will also keep you updated on my progress on HD policy.","lil bro thinks he can do policy change .
The policy was in place before this year’s freshmen applied.  It was clearly spelled out at the top of the application.  You had the choice of not attending Berkeley, or choosing a major that was listed as high demand in your application, if you really wanted that major.   Even so, there are still 50+ L&S majors that you can still choose from today, without having to go thru any review.  Some of the 12 impacted majors might even be giving a one-year reprieve on declaring. 

I do agree though that not being able to double major in two high demand majors should not have been spelled out.  If you’re already in an impacted major and wanted to double in another high-demand major, I don’t see an issue with just having the student apply for it and try to get in via comprehensive review.
Honestly, maybe this will stop applicants from trying to beat the system by applying with a random major to try to get admitted knowing that they will have very little chance to switch to something they really wanted but didn't want to risk not getting admitted at all.
It’s pretty annoying, but I think the reason is largely that the university doesn’t have the resources to accommodate such demand.

Thank God I’m class of 2026. I can still do my triple major in 3 high demand subjects lol
you're only affected if you're currently Class of 2027 or after (meaning out of current students, only freshmen). the reason they implemented this last year for a not yet admitted class and later was because there has always been significant opposition against major restrictions for current students.
This just means no “back door” you must apply to at least one of your HD majors if u intend to major in it. If you discover it later you can still potentially add one but two would be difficult later on anyway.
just be a CNR student and u don’t gotta deal with this bs lmao. AND you can actually talk to an advisor 🤣
Pretty straightforward tbh
""Yeah, we need to make enrollment sustainable. So we are just gonna cut off students' access to these majors and have them suffer in anxiety and agony with our comprehensive review.""

if you wanted the major why didnt you apply for it on the application ?

"" Anxiety and Agony"" its not that deep . Just dont expect to get in and you should be good
Hey it sucks but every major school is doing something similar for computer science.
I agree, there is more transparency needed and tbf to Berkeley they will likely provide more specifics in time for the application process. However, anyone who wanted access to a HD major should be applying to that major. Whatever this discoverer pathway turns out to be, it won't have a ton of seats or have an easier admissions process.
This high demand is very frustrating especially because there’s such little information they’re giving. It feels like they’re changing the rules every day. In previous years, students just had to meet a gpa requirement but now we can’t even apply to two hd majors we’re interested in. 

Also, the advisors themselves are confused about the policy and giving conflicting information. Many did not know you could only apply to 1 HD major.

Also, the comprehensive review apparently only takes place once after 2 and half years which is crazy that you have to wait that long.
Nope 😎 applied math major and I get DSP priority reg
L&S sucks ngl
When will they release more information on this comprehensive review thing?
This school is dogshit ngl
[deleted]
can u elaborate? :0
Thank you for your comments. I believe the reason why students (like me) chose ""undeclared"" is because we genuinely did not know what we wanted to do during the time of application. And like what other posts had said, how can you simply know what you want to do when you are only 17/18? Now that we are deciding on a major or majors, options for us are now being unreasonably restricted. From that perspective, I would argue that this is extremely unfair for us undeclared students.
And just with regards to your comment about choosing to not attend Berkeley, I just wanted to point out that there are many other reasons (e.g., financial, family, etc.) as to why a student chooses a university other than the major that they were being accepted into. For me, what I love about going to a US uni is the fact that they understand people's interests slowly change and allow people to spend time in uni to decide on what they really like rather than choose a major hastily because they have to.
Where’d you find the information about the reprieve?
CS + DS majors in Co26 looking at the trainwreck behind them…
Lmao fr
Stanford

MIT

Any Ivy League school

Georgia Tech

To name a few
You knew all this info before you applied for admission. Why didn’t you just apply directly to the major you were interested in?
Don't ask the L&S advisors, go straight to the department advisors. They are not confused. They will tell you exactly what is happening for that HD major.
wait really ? i thought you can apply after your freshman if you completed all the pre reqs
It was, but [it isn't any more](https://ls.berkeley.edu/ls-high-demand-majors-first-year-students):

>Note: Statistics was a high-demand major for Fall 2023 applicants only. As of Spring 2023, Statistics is no longer a high-demand major. Students declaring this major Summer 2023 and later will not be subject to high-demand policies.
these plans have been years in the making.  They involve millions of dollars and where they should be allocated. This was a switch from nearly a decade's long policy. To think the school will give a flying fuck about what some angry freshman thinks on Reddit of all places is comical.
I’m going to take a wild guess and say that as a truly undeclared student, you may be at an advantage when applying to declare for a impacted major via holistic/comprehensive review over a student who is declared for something else.  In CS for example, one of the main criteria for holistic evaluation is that the person is a “discoverer”, one that has discovered the major through osmosis and love of taking CS classes at Berkeley.  As opposed to someone majoring in some other major and trying to backdoor their way in.
I think I read somewhere where DS is allowing people this year who want to declare to just do it.  Not sure if this is true or not.  I know that incoming transfer students (not incoming freshmen) can attempt to declare using the old 3.3 gauntlet for CS for one last time. Don’t know about other majors, you’ll have to check.

It's pretty clear that the admission rates varied by major (CS << DS < L&S average) so getting into stats doesn't necessarily imply you would have gotten into DS. And it's not very clear (to me) how many people who got rejected from high-demand majors were accepted to alternate majors (or undeclared). I do know what you mean but I'd be happy I got into Cal and set out to make the most of it."
What's Up with EECS?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tjnxcd/whats_up_with_eecs/,2022-03-21 15:32:17,"Important Note:  This is based on my observations at Minion Level.  Theoretically the chairs and deans could do something.



The EECS department is shattering under load due to having gone from 400 graduates a year a decade ago to 1400 graduates/year now. 15% of the University is graduating in either EECS or L&S CS, a load that is breaking the department through a combination of both budgetary pressure and the grind of so many students.

The TL:DR is that the University formula for how teaching funds are distributed (the “TAS budget”) is broken.  The department gets roughly $200 for a student in a typical 4-unit class, but costs roughly $375 to hire all the TAs necessary, with the remaining $175 coming out of other departmental money.  This departmental funding comes from “profitable” programs (M.Eng, extension, and summer) and a portion from the University that is basically a function of the size of the faculty in the department, which clearly hasn’t scaled with demand.

So the EECS department is running a deficit of a few million dollars a year and the only ways to fix it are for either the University to actually fund undergraduate teaching or for EECS to drastically cut enrollment by over 50%!  And it isn’t a lot of money.  Perhaps $4-5M a year.

But the budget is almost an excuse.  The teaching load is ridiculous and things are failing.  If we lose one or two critical must-teach-every-semester upper division classes (e.g. 161, 186, 188, 189) we lose the undergraduate talent pipeline necessary to support 1000+ students a year in that class.  Even someone like me, who likes teaching, has grown exhausted from teaching just the same two classes on a continuous basis.

The department has to take drastic action.  Last year there was a rejected attempt to reduce L&S by turning it into an EECS-style freshman admission.  Since that failed there is a pending vote to cut the size of the major through the back-door.  By restricting CS70 to just those who were admitted as EECS or CS through L&S, this would cut in half the number of students who declare CS or EECS.

There is an asterisk in the proposal for existing L&S and non-EECS Engineering students but that is “budget permitting” and, as clearly visible, the budget doesn’t actually permit this.  And if the department was serious about allowing existing students they wouldn’t have capped CS70 this summer at just 200 students, since summer classes (due to their profitable nature) normally scale to support however many students wish to take a class.

What does this mean?  First, nothing is official yet.  The vote result is unannounced, and even then there could be a miracle and Berkeley actually decides to fund EECS to a level necessary to meet demand.  But color me unhopeful.

So assuming it passes, what does it mean?

If you are considering Berkeley for CS starting Fall 2022 but didn’t select “CS” or “EECS” on the application form you will need to go someplace else.  I doubt any policy will protect you, and the department’s failure to communicate this already infuriates me.

If you were admitted as EECS or selected “CS” for a Letters and Science admission you should be OK.  Well, in the same sinking boat as everyone else if the department fails in maintaining the upper division.

If you are L&S but didn’t check “CS”, or a non-EECS Engineering student, it may be impossible to get into CS if you can’t get into CS70 this summer.  The only thing that can save you is if somehow the University is willing to provide enough money to actually teach the demand.

If the department had the funding it could possibly develop the will to continue to teach at our scale.  But since I doubt the money would ever come, there is no sense trying to cultivate the will.","I planned on double majoring in applied math and CS, will this somehow also affect the ability to use Math 55 in place of CS 70 for the declaration of both majors?
Can we protest for more EECS funding? Like can the university appropriate funding changes radically if we really got out and made it hurt for them?
The EECS department has become absolutely laughable with this policy. If a student was admitted to Cal prior to Fall 2022 it makes absolutely no sense for them to be punished by a policy that did not exist when they applied for admission.
Why the fuck does the department get $200 per student for a 4 unit class when tuition is $7000/semester? At 16 units, <12% of tuition is spent on the actual classes. This isn’t even considering out of state tuition. Fuck administration.
When should vote announcement be expected to release?
One addition: it isn't just a matter of ""which class"" in terms of budget priorities, it is that for every class we have that bind.  So with 6 lower division classes (61A/B/C, 70, 16A/B) and 5 upper division classes, an additional EECS or CS student costs the department roughly $2000.
although i’m non EECS and will never be, this is absolutely infuriating and unacceptable for any university, let alone berkeley. this fact, coupled with the fact that berkeley is one of the big 3 CS schools is a laughable irony. the only thing saving berkeley is it’s old name of its glory days. this university is a sinking ship truly in the EECS department and in the larger administrative context. sad to see this.
I understand why the department would need to but this policy would be pretty trash - wish there was something else that could be done :( I think it would have a negative impact on gender diversity in CS too; EECS has a much worse gender ratio than L&S CS and the impression I get is that lot of women in CS are of the ""took CS 61A and realized they liked CS"" type rather than knowing they liked CS from highschool.
I hope the department taking drastic action will produce some reaction from the university but i guess that's unlikely.
Every day I’m more and more surprised as to how a T4 CS school can’t even provide one of it’s most renowned departments enough money to survive. It’s genuinely astonishing that the school can charge OOS students like me >60K/year, but can’t even guarantee actually being able to take classes.
Don't worry everyone the university will pay another diversity dean 300k soon in order to solve this issue
Thanks Nicholas for bringing this to the public’s attention. As a parent of an incoming Freshman. I would think management and counsel at UCB would know that implementing this without up front notice to the applicants would undoubtedly result in numerous lawsuits or class action. The CS website clearly states that all L&S are admitted as undeclared and can declare CS upon meeting the requirements. UCB can’t possibly have attorneys that are dumb enough not to know implementing this without notice would be disastrous.
This stresses me out so much. Im a second semester freshman and I switched in to l&s from ChemE. Can I really not declare? That feels life-ruining to me. This is awful
Why couldn’t they tell me this sooner. I’m an incoming freshman who applied undeclared and recently got accepted. After a couple months of thinking, I realized my heart is in computer science. If I knew this was happening I would’ve put that I intended to declare cs on my application when I was applying. But I can’t go back in time and do that now. This absolutely sucks, especially for incoming freshman like me.
Nick, thank you for always being honest and communicative with the students on issues like this. It's great seeing students talking about this and informing the newly admitted freshman class (by linking to this post) about this potential policy change.

It was wonderful having you as my professor this semester, your presence here has made Berkeley a better school.
The whole motto of L&S’s breadth requirement is for students to be well rounded and figure out of what they like, and this policy goes completely against that mission. 

The point of classes such as CS10 is to expose students who come from under-privileged schooling to computer science with the hopes that they like it and major in it in order to level the playing field in the CS/Tech sector. 

So if you’re not a kid from the South Bay or don’t have rich parents that can place you in schools with CS programs, tough luck. 

I guess the Tech field is still going to be dominated by Asian and white males thanks to short sighted policies like these.
Dang didn’t know it’s grown by 1000 students
What does this mean for someone who is a chem or physics major and wants to take a meaningful number of CS courses to support their interest in programming?
Dang are you serious!! I applied as economics major in L&S and got in but I rlly want to do computer science. Will I have the chance to declare cs as my major, if I do decide to switch? I’m entering in the fall of 2022
[deleted]
Do you think the money for funding is there or is the university strapped for cash?
So, I’m not cs/eecs, but I don’t understand why the dept can’t just raise the gpa cap to 3.5 or 3.6 as a buffer while they work out funding. It would cut a decent amount of students but not stop those that ended up “discovering” the major later. Is there something major that I’m missing? 

This is what the psych Dept did a few years ago (raised to a 3.3 when the budget was tight) and it seemed to work for them (it just turned back to 3.0)

I feel like that would be a fairer option for students coming from different backgrounds and academic paths
Is there any update on this or when a final decision will be made?
Anything new now? Thanks!

I think we should all calm the fuck down. They can't possibly enforce this policy on current students cause that's not what we were told when we entered the university. They explicitly said that everyone is undeclared. If they want to enforce this, it should be enforced for future students entering the university and they should explicitly be told so in the application process. 

If this goes through with current students, I am willing to take legal action and I'm not joking when I say this. This is literally an act of fraud IF it applies to current students and we aren't grandfathered in. This back-door limitation to cs70 nonsense to current uc Berkeley student is utter bullshit.
This sounds like dire straits, having to decrease student enrollment after Newsom just signed legislation to nix the enrollment cap. It sounds like the department needs to prioritize increasing its revenue so that it can meet its undergraduate teaching obligations. I wish them luck in doing so!
A week later, I'm wondering what the status is with this decision. They probably can't get away with changing the l&s major after freshman already applied and got their decisions, especially with some committing already
Is there any way to quickly raise money for the department? At this point, it feels like more funding is the only palatable option.
I have to say that it's sad to see the state of the department be like this especially in terms of funding. Do you think it's possible for the department to take a more extreme option such as declared L&S CS not getting enrollment priority in upper division courses and only giving that priority to EECS?
What if I am taking 61a and 70 this semester, will I be able to take 61b and declare next year?

(I am undeclared L&S didn't check CS)
Tf nicholas weaver? You are creating unnecessary anxiety and distressed to students. If it is not confirmed about the cs70 enrollment then you should not say anything at all.
wait is this even legally allowed? Im pretty sure they can't do this to current students who were admitted under the impression that they could enroll in cs70. They could only enforce this for upcoming classes and not people already at Berkeley right?

Also, what if I'm intended applied math, but am already enrolled in cs70 for the summer and not on the waitlist? Am I good since, Ill still have taken all the required classes to declare.
[deleted]
I'm wondering if this will only apply to cs 70 and not the 61 series and eecs 16a and eecs 16b? I am trying to change major to eecs from coe major and is almost sure that cs70 is not needed.
Would this affect fall 2022 L&S transfers? AFAIK  transfers are admitted undeclared in L&S
What if someone was trying to minor in CS? Would they be affected too?
Just to confirm, we do not know how our tuition money is being allocated, correct? I pay out of state tuition and I truly do not understand where all that money goes. As an OOS CS major, this is frustrating and reading about this situation makes it worse.
This post from an alumni rings so true now.
https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qocx7x/eecs_and_ls_most_viable_option_is_to_get_funding/

Do you agree/disagree with any of the points here? If you don’t mind sharing. If you can’t because work stuff, no biggie. /u/NicholasWeaver

Poster mentions interesting and compelling points. The bolded points summarize it all.
I do agree with the poster that Berkeley is California’s flagship university and California is the richest state so something can be. Most of the time California has a budget SURPLUS of billions. I would think it would be relatively “easy” for the Regents to allocate money for the CS department here. 

Also, the poster mentions how the university needs to be more transparent with accounting as you said. I find it funny we have to mention it at all for a PUBLIC university.
BOO! Cal has the funding! They’re choosing to spend it elsewhere!! It also has a #1 CS national reputation! Cal is world-class! Live up to it!!

Suggestions- Definitely Offer alternative intended major option @ Cal! Especially  for ECCS, so kids who choose ECCS & aren’t accepted can get in to Cal as DS or Cog Sci. 

Make DS a direct major, like UCSD does. Students will be more likely to stay razor focused on it, rather than straying to CS. Fill DS w/ the ECCS kids who picked it as an alternate. Spread the love!
Hi, so I recently got accepted into EECS for the class of 2026. Should I be worried about the funding issues? I'm going to be focusing on Electrical Engineering btw, not really CS.
What if you are admitted to another major within COE? Will this yet to be announced policy block kids from doing a change of major to EECS?
[deleted]
Looks like a false alarm
Don't some Data Science/Machine learning classes have CS70 as a pre req though?
aaaand somebody already figured out the way around the proposed throttling mechanism.
As a current applied math major, it would break my heart to watch hundreds of students majoring in math just to take M55 in lieu of CS70 then struggle really, really hard in upper div classes (i.e., Math 104, 185, 128A, 113, and 110)
I'm down for a protest at Sproul.
that's kind of the goal, i think. we've been trying to convince them for quite some time...
Again, this policy is NOT official, and there are claims that those who entered prior to Fall 2022 will still be allowed to take 70, but I'm personally skeptical given the excuse is budget not teaching load.
If you get in as a non CS/EECS applicant the university doesn’t owe it to you to allow you to declare a different major.
I also think this is ridiculous, but what I understood is that this is for TA only. You have to account for faculty pay as well. In Econ, most profs teach only one undergrad course a year, and some not even that.
The priority of the University is the football team and the @ass_deans.  It burns me up that this is the case.
Imagine being a top 5 school in the hottest field on the planet and thinking ""yeah nah fuck giving them enough money to run their classes"" istg
Because expenses are not just instruction related?
From the way this is phrased, probably never? It sounds like a backroom vote of only higher ups (since evidently Weaver, a ""minion"", is not able to do this vote). It would probably be silently passed and enforced.
No clue.
As many suggested, retroactively gating CS70 after a student is admitted is worse than raising the GPA cap. Why not have a ~$200 lab fee for each underfunded courses that will be waived only for EE/CS declared/intended?
Like most universities above a certain size the real priority are the football team and the ass_deans.

The money we are talking about is slightly more than we pay our 5-7 football coach ($3M a year) and significantly less in what the University pays in Stadium debt ($10M a year), a debt that was supposed to be paid by the ""independently"" ""profitable"" athletic department.
Funding Crises such as this just makes me want to get my degree ASAP and get out of here.
The data from the town hall was 20% EECS vs 28% CS so the current gap while non-trivial may be smaller than you'd think (that translates to ~100 women). Surprisingly, URM was 6% EECS vs 4% CS.
Spot on!!
Agreed. UCB is also home to a T14 law school, and some of the most renowned legal scholars in America. It's flabbergasting how this policy was even considered. Probably a measure by one of the idiot deans if I had to guess.
We don't know yet, but it is highly likely that you won't be able to declare CS if you can't take 61A/B/70 before Fall.
[deleted]
Yeup.  It is NOT official, and they may not do this, but I really don't trust the department not to put in such a policy.
I got into ucsd for cs. Do you guys think I should go to ucsd if I want to become a SWE or will getting a data science degree from Berkeley be a better decision.
You can usually email admissions and ask to be considered for a major change if it’s early enough.
Glad to hear it.
This exactly. But honestly, I think people intentionally backdooring the system ruins it for everyone.
Some upper divs are takeable if you phase 1. That seems like it's about it

edit: was wrong
Yes I'm serious.  The vote happened weeks ago, but the actual announcement of what it means has not been done yet for some reason, including critical answers like ""can L&S students take CS classes""
[deleted]
seems like a mix of both -- notably, eecs is not the only department that's currently underfunded. we don't get the full numbers from the university wrt where the money ends up going, but between all the administrative fees involved with running the university, athletics (which do yield a net profit at the end of the day), and academics, there seems to not be enough money to go around. sadly, over the last few years, we've kind of given campus the impression that our classes are infinitely scalable, and we kind of continue to do so, which leads to our pleas for more funding to be deprioritized.

eecs is an expensive department due to our sheer size, so we've managed to wear thin the university's ability to fund us -- where the initial lack of inflow is, i don't know, but it sure would be nice to figure it out and fix it.
Its strange.  On one hand the University is tight on money.  OTOH, back in 2020 the chancellor was able to find $20M for the athletic department (enough so in the end they showed a $4M 'profit' as a consequence).
a GPA cap of 3.6 would simply be ridiculous. If you got two A-'s and a B+, you would fail to declare. People already damn near kill themselves with stress over the 3.3 and I can't imagine raising it higher would do anything but make it exponentially worse
Problem is, enough students get >3.6 that this still wouldn't solve the issue, and the demand for cs doesn't look to be going down anytime soon.
The vote itself happened and was completed on the 15th, no announcement or details has yet to be provided and I have no clue when that will happen.
and that's why it's under consideration, not already enacted :) there's sufficient movement to try to grandfather current students in this policy, because none of us really *want* this. if push comes to shove though, the university isn't really giving us a ton of options.
We don't know.  There should be official word soon I hope (that it hasn't come out yet is a huge amount of frustration for me).  When you applied to L&S did you specify an intended major or just ""undeclared""?
Current high school seniors (decisions are out) and possibly juniors as well (CO 2026, CO 2027) should not be having to take the fallout of this either.

There was no mention of this during applications (to my knowledge) and most current hs seniors who have been admitted could have committed to Cal as early as last Thursday March. 24th (potentially even earlier for some programs/majors).

Bait and switch.
You got the part where your college (L&S) is the one slow-walking CoE/EECS plans for managing the major in question (BA CS), right? While increasing its own enrollment, which has an ever-growing proportion of students who want to declare CS? 

This would basically be EECS saying to L&S, you guys made promises to your admits that you haven't helped us fund, good luck with that because we're out of money to close that gap. I imagine EECS can cover its obligations to its own majors.
Who knows?  But I'm getting more hopeful that existing L&S students will be OK, but the lack of communication is still frustrating me, as the incoming students need formal notification.
That'd be very unfair and make L&S CS literally a second-class major. At that point just end the program. In the past 10 years, L&S CS went from 170 students to 1700 students (10x) while EECS only went from 1000 students to 1700 students (2x). I applaud the department for trying to keep it running but the enrollment issue is because L&S CS has grown exponentially. 

Source: https://eecs.berkeley.edu/about/by-the-numbers
this solution doesn't help the department, actually -- we're still required to graduate all of our students, so if we treat l&s cs as second-class students, we're just shooting ourselves in the foot even more. the only possible action in this direction would be to get rid of the l&s cs major entirely, which wouldn't happen until existing students in the major have graduated (and honestly the dept doesn't plan to get rid of the major, or they would've done so ages ago).
Unknown.  The plans if they happen are for the entire lower division sequence to be restricted, but so many other majors rely on 61AB that it is unclear whether that could happen.

But I’d probably be paranoid and take 61B in the summer, since that will expand to support as many students as want to take it.
The only way it isn't going to happen is if the students take action now:  Quiet attempts to resolve the crisis have failed and the only time we had success was when we basically cut the upper division visibly and students vigorously objected.  Then somehow the money got found.

So if the L&S students who didn't check ""CS"" on admission want to still get into the major, there is going to need to be a significant chunk of money (as it is close to $1M for the department to support just those students over their undergraduate career), and the only way that money will be found is if those affected by such a cruel decision object, object loudly, and object strongly.

And the only way those affected will know to object is if they know about it.

And it is clear it is likely to happen:  This is why 70, unlike all the other summer school classes, hasn't expanded already but is instead still capped at 200.  Summer school is profitable in itself to the department, the only reason to cap it at 200 is to keep people from being able to take the class and therefore be able to declare the major before restrictions go into place in the fall.

So this is why I feel it was necessary to speak out and explain the situation now.
I can also confirm to what Nick Weaver is saying. And putting pressure now is important so there’s some initial planning on how to protest when the university does announce.
Its scummy but they are going to try.  Pushback from students is going to be one of the few things that CAN stop this.

And yeah, being in 70 this summer is a Good Thing, because since this is a backdoor attempt to cap the major there are limits to what the department is able to do on its own.
Shouldn’t be affecting 61 because it’s needed for other majors
If you were an L&S transfer who said ""Computer Science"" you should be OK.
The minor is as good as dead: Restricting 61C and the upper division to majors only is also going to happen as part of this.
The university is amazingly opaque about its budgeting and spending.  I've been contemplating what it would take to do a public records act to get the raw data...
You don't need to be worried.  You are already in the major, and the upper division EE classes are not in the overwhelmed mode the CS classes are.
Unknown.

this ""way around"" is extremely difficult and unlikely to be a main route so i highly doubt so many more people will become CS's through it
except L&S majors aren't read during admissions
Regular faculty pay is the biggest line item, but the $ doesn't just come from tuition but a lot of other sources as well.  

And the University is deliberately opaque about the actual numbers but it does seem that the amount going to TAS (Lecturers/TAs) is a bit over 10% of tuition and that is it.
I just don’t get how the university keeps getting away with underfunding the biggest department at Berkeley, and arguably one that has provided Berkeley with a lot fame and good name. Doing cs at Berkeley was/is considered equivalent in caliber and ROI to most Ivy Leagues if not more. 

I don’t understand how other departments get so much more funding. If you compare football, no offense, we r not up there with the best teams. No undergrad considers going to this school with football as their biggest priority (except the football team). They do however consider the funding of their intended department and I have talked to multiple new admits this year that are no longer considering Berkeley upon seeing this mess.
Football (and Basketball) brings money in FYI. They actually fund other sports and therefore scholarships.
Agreed. Ultimately the state should have a greater responsibility in contributing to those who will ultimately contribute to the economy (since many CS majors stay in the Bay Area) tenfold.
But like what expenses? There's literally extra fees tacked onto tuition costs. A [blog](https://blogs.berkeley.edu/2020/03/12/why-does-uc-berkeley-need-6-billion/#:~:text=Tuition%20income%20is%20now%20a,income%20and%20middle%2Dclass%20students.) from the econ dept mentions 33 percent is allocated towards covering low and middle income students tuition so that leaves about 57 percent unaccounted for.

Reading more of that link it seems like the state has forced UCs to cover more of the capital costs of building and maintaining its buildings ( state contribution went from 70 to 10 percent from 1970 to present).
It won't be silent on enforcement, but silence on passing until the decision to enforce.  Enforcement has to be public because the enrollment system actualyl doesn't allow this, so Cindy Conners will be driven crazy having to give authorization codes to a ton of L&S students.
Cuz that will do wonders for the income-inequality that we see so prevalently in engineering.
i guess the institutional priorities do lie someplace else. the irony of CS being berkeley’s hallmark program while simultaneously being the worst fiscally managed department is fuckin stupid lol
While I totally agree that EECS needs more funding (graduated EECS student here) and that the athletics were supposed to pay the stadium debt, the $3M argument around our coach is a bit incorrect. Generically, coach salaries are usually a few 100k, and then the rest is paid for by boosters/tv revenue/not state money. It seems like Coach Wilcox's  contract matches that structure [with a base salary of $250k](https://www.si.com/college/cal/news/wilcox-contract-details#:~:text=Cal%20football%20coach%20Justin%20Wilcox's,prior%20to%20any%20performance%20bonuses).   


Again, you likely know way more about this than I do, given I was merely a student, but my understanding of coaching contracts is that it rarely is a school's funding paying the whole amount, [as shown in this older, and weirdly anti-teacher WSJ article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122853304793584959).  


I am curious however, why schools like UCLA don't seem to be suffering the same fate? They pay a lot of their coaches, and presumably have similar CS graduation rates, but people I know there seem to not suffer from these issues.
Interesting, when I checked the major data last it was 15% EECS and 25% CS so maybe it's improved.
Is there anything at all I can do?
Note that the CS minor is effectively killed by this as well: the UD classes will also end up being majors only.
Life ruining?  Maybe not, but that really fuckin blows, given how grossly oversaturated the entry level CS labor market is.  A Berkeley CS degree will help you stand out, which you *really* have to do these days if you like having a job and not starving.

Am also SWE, and recent L&S CS alum (Nick Weaver here taught my favorite class, 161).
Would you refer some younger bears?
Lol humble brag much 🙄
What is TC?
Go to UCSD for CS.  It is really a top school, with top faculty, small class sizes, and doesn’t have the “being crushed by scale” that Berkeley has.

Data Science at Berkeley is really a mutt major anyway, it was intended as a way of siphoning off CS demand by having the upper division classes taught by other departments.  And it will positively explode with the restrictions on CS.

Since most departments have a funding model that is “the more you teach the more $ you lose”, it wouldn’t surprise me if at least some of the classes that count for DS get turned into “majors only” by the host departments over the next couple of years.
[deleted]
please be careful when discussing the scalability of 61abc -- i'm the 61a head TA, and i can guarantee you that we're reaching our limit wrt scalability. scaling these courses is not a constant factor, we still do need at least linear scaling in the amount of staff we have. if the department can't provide us with enough funds to hire enough TAs, we can't expand beyond a certain capacity.

we in fact already enforced this this semester -- the only reason 61a managed to expand was because of concurrent enrollment and the fact that we managed to convince the department to let us hire enough additional TAs (and it took a tiring amount of convincing).
Upper div CS classes outside of maybe CS 170 is already almost impossible to get into and with new department policies that are being voted on (restricting UD to only CS/EECS students) and more EECS and L&S students pushing for things like waitlist reordering, you can realistically expect to not be able to get into any CS UD classes unless you are a CS major (or minor) or a department that helps fund CS classes (like DS).
Wow I guess I will wait until the vote does happen, because I’m not going to a school where I can’t declare cs
Also, this is just supposed to be the core mission for the university.  I suspect that if we went hat-in-hand to silicon valley and said ""We need $5M a year to keep churning out the graduates you expect"" we might be able to get it...  

Until someone realizes that we are talking an amount equal to 10% of the TUITITON payments of OUR STUDENTS.
I agree. The university can randomly find money for various things but not enough for student support.
Will this impact the class of 2026 since this change was not communicated to us when we were applying? I’ve heard that it will likely be implemented for the following class (2027).
Professor, do you think the class of 2025 will be grandfathered in?
[deleted]
this is exactly my pov actually -- the way i see it, l&s promised me and all of its other students the ability to study ""anything we want"" but didn't really do much on the backend to help make this a reality. eecs isn't even the only underfunded department, but is one of the few departments with a dual obligation, which puts us in an interesting position relative to other majors.
Any update? It seems unfair that this will impact incoming freshmen since this policy change was not made clear to them at the time of the application.
Yeah exactly. I had gotten a *ton* of college rejections in the winter. My parents are both into CS and formally introduced it to me as a career option and I worked hard and fell in love with it. I'm heavily considering pursuing it in college so hearing this news totally blows. When you say that existing L&S students will be okay, are you talking about admits for fall 2022 as well? Do you think it's likely that this thing will pass? I'm sorry to ask questions that it sounds like nobody has the answer to. Figured I'd ask anyway.
Oh I definitely agree that it isn't fair but was more so highlighting what options the department would take if nothing is being done to resolve this crisis.
Thank you for sharing then. I selected as an intended CS major when I apply for last year, so I should be good. I hope that everyone get to to the major that they are truly passionate about.
I had a similar question to u/Jackwagon1130. If this does in fact get passed, does that mean that Fall 2022 admissions in L&S can't take CS70 and hence declare CS?  


Aside from that I really appreciate you providing us with some actual information. It's very frustrating that there's potential for such a high-level university to be so blatantly unfair to students. We've heard absolutely nothing from admissions about this, so your posts have been incredibly helpful. Thank You.
but if i applied for another L&S major (applied math) and wanted to declare CS that wouldn’t be allowed? yikes.
Oh that's good to hear. I hope the situation gets better for CS peeps. Thank you!
Thanks. The lack of transparency and certainty is just bewildering and insulting to students.
Well if someone wants to major in CS but didn’t know that prior to attending; this seems like the only way to still study CS here. I don’t know what someone would do if they did not also want to do Applied Math
What currently happens if you drop or fail to complete one of multiple declared L&S majors? I was under the impression that the answer was, ""nothing."" (I was CoE.)
Well, now they are.  L&S this year deliberately penalized those who said they wanted to do CS rather than just doing what the department wanted and just apply the COE EECS standard with formal freshman admission.

2021 the ""CS intended"" was >400.  2022 the expectation is ~150 or so.
If the intended major didn't matter when reading admissions, then people should have no problem putting CS as their intended major. Therefore, this policy change shouldn't be an issue for anyone other than like 5% of people who truly had a change of passion.
Yeah, I also think this is ridiculous. But just as an example, I just checked the course catalog and transparent california, and there is one faculty teaching an undergraduate upper div course with 26 seats whose total pay is \~431k. We can probably find a lot more similar cases.
Unfortunately not, the myth of academic department profitability is just that, a myth.
Which is why the Memorial Stadium retrofitting debt is so crazy. Over 400 Million in debt that we're not expected to pay back for over 100 years, just to field the least successful football team in the least successful Power-5 conference. Meanwhile, the budget for the engineering school is so fucked because money for this dumbass project 100% came out of academic departments and other campus improvement projects.

I feel like there would be a black market for selling enrollment codes as AFAIK you can't make enrollment codes specific to a person, sounds like a lot of work for nothing. If only a PhD student could make a new version of calcentral or something...  


Edit: nvm they can be made student-specific
but isn't it kind of the same, just making the issue obvious instead of trying to bury it? Not allowing discovery is essentially kicking out anyone who did not have the opportunity to find they enjoyed CS in high school or earlier, which generally correlated directly on income brackets since these sorts of programs are only offered at well funded schools. Opting to just quietly block these students from enrolling is frankly more offensive because it hides the issue
Economic incentives are the only real incentive to keep people from applying to back door majors in the first place.
It's really sad too when you look at other top public CS schools like UIUC and UWash where they are both able to support a big CS student body and have enough staff per student ratio.
for what it's worth, most people i've spoken with have confirmed that the football team yields a net profit despite the high raw numbers when it comes to expenses, getting rid of football is hardly the solution, and could in fact hurt budgets more.
[deleted]
A lot of it is despite the direct ban on race or gender based selection, the admissions process can pick up on a lot of proxies, proxies not present in the L&S ""just get a 3.3 and declare"" process.
Complain to the chancellor.  She was able to find some $20M for the athletic department in 2020, perhaps she can find $5M for the EECS department?
total compensation
Total Compensation, cringe word that losers use to define their value
Also Suraj Rampure teaches at UCSD and he's the best.
What data science is doing is having a separate section for CS classes using their own funding. They’re currently a lot better off financially than the CS/EECS with all the donations they’ve received. 

For example, this semester they funded their own section of CS 189. My guess is we’re going to see more of that.
sg edited
Donors rarely want to fund core operating expenses, they want to fund growth and capital programs. It's well understood that giving orgs money for core operations often leads to bad discipline - short term deferral of financially necessary decisions and long term dependency on external money.

In this case, a donor would see that L&S failing to find $5M to teach its own admits means that L&S is avoiding cutting $5M from programs with less impact/demand. In effect, a donation to ""EECS teaching"" is really enabling the L&S deans to protect ~20 L&S FTE (non-soft-money staff layoffs due to departmental merger, faculty layoffs due to departmental closure, pre SOE lecturer cuts, tenure line extinction, etc.). A rich alum might well be ok with that but businesses might be unimpressed with the situation.
<3 this made my day
U a 2022 admit?
Any update on this?
In your case, if you double-majored in CS and Math, and took Math 55 it’s likely you can circumvent the immediate issue.  Not necessarily ideal but at least you got an option.
I believe Math 55 only substitutes for CS 70 if you are a math double: if you drop the math double you will need to take CS70 (or more appropriately [47F](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/EECS47F/)) to have your CS degree completed. I could be wrong but that's my understanding of the process
Is there any source online about this? I don't get why they would prevent students who selected other L&S majors in their application from declaring CS AND only accept 150 students. That would essentially cut the number of cs majors by 60%, which seems a bit much.
How is it fair that they penalize L&S CS applicants without saying anything. If they wanted to penalize them why didn’t they say so publicly?
Hey, hold up here. This seems like important news. Aside from the rubric, this sounds like the town hall plan is already being partially enacted by L&S. In which case we might speculate that throttling CS 70 right now is a temporary way to prevent a flood of last minute old school declarations before the discovery path (with its very low acceptance rate) is rolled out.

Discovery path would suck for current non-intended students, but not as badly as complete inability to declare.

That person is Haas.  I don't know how haas manages such salaries for Unit 18 folks...
Football and basketball bring money in. That’s a fact. However the total athletics department is a net negative, because football and basketball alone do not entirely cover the other sports. But I don’t see you or anyone else in here complaining about gymnastics or water polo
[deleted]
No. Even the new enrollment center UI is crappy.
You can do specific permissions to enroll. This is how ugrad enrollment in math grad classes worked this semester.
I agree.
They don't.  They are half the size we are in terms of students.  UIUC graduates a hair over 500, we graduate 1400...
They do that by having way less students (which they do by having direct admittance). UWash has 1500 CS students according to [this page](https://www.cs.washington.edu/about_us#:~:text=We%20have%20roughly%2080%20full,450%20Bachelors%20degrees%20per%20year).

There are more than 1500 students in 61a alone... And yes, not all of them will be CS majors, but that's also one class vs the entire cumulative 4 year student body at UWash.
Yeah, it's P5 sports.  The football team carries the whole ass athletic department.  Some men's basketball teams turn a profit, but I doubt Cal's does.  UConn WBB might also, but I don't remember.  But otherwise, without football, college athletics is entirely unsustainable.

And yeah, coaching budget is largely out of the pockets of donors that are donating specifically to football.
Yeah, universities have multiple different budgets that don't really interact. There's housing, parking, food, athletics, medicine (at some UCs). All of these are more or less independent of the academic budget. You should look at them as independent businesses.
Yeah, but if we played at the Colosseum would revenue drop by 400 million?
I see, thank you for the insightful links! Do you think given what Prof. Weaver is saying this might actually be an argument for the idea that we have failed to show that it is possible? It seems like we've just been more willing to abuse our faculty and students than most and have thus stretched it out this long.
Yeah only losers make money /s
Ah thanks. All I could think of was take home pay.
Yep
It seems really unfair that they’re applying this retroactively — I applied to this school under the assumption that L&S allows me to pursue whatever major i want
it looks like 47f hasn't been offered for a while... maybe they bring it back with this decision ?
[deleted]
The goal reported in the town hall was to knock things down from the current BA CS cohort size of 900-1000 to 270, with 200 of those being ""direct"" admits. So, considerably more than a 60% cut.
Don't get me wrong, I would much rather prefer an increase in funding. All I am pointing out is that if you truly believe majors aren't part of the decision process, then put cs as your intended major. And as Prof. Nicholas pointed out, putting intended cs did lower admissions so its not just doing nothing. Also, whatever decision they make isn't going to drastically change their issues(either positively or negatively) in the next four years so I don't really care personally. I am just against people knowingly backdooring things, whether it affects me or not.
No, they are not - I don't want to post their name because of privacy, but we can discuss about that in DM's. Plenty of Econ professors that do not have joint appointments with Haas have similar salaries. I'm not familar with pay in EECS, but I imagine is not that different.
What’s up with the stanford class enrollment site? I’ve never heard anything about it until now
Oh tell me more, can you make it as specific as to the intended major you put down when applying to L&S? I’ve only seen more general categories like L&S undeclared or L&S CS.
Does this take into account the CS+X majors?
We graduate 1300 combined from L&S CS and EECS combined every year, compared to UW which graduates 450 from CS & CE every year. I think people should realize why we have budget issues is because L&S CS (which is an offering of the EECS degree essentially through L&S and doesn't receive as much budget as a proper CoE spot) has grown 10x in the past 10 years from 170 students to 1700 students. EECS went from 1k to 1700 in the same timeframe. 

Source: https://eecs.berkeley.edu/about/by-the-numbers
Yeah, I think generically this is my issue with the follow up comments from Professor Weaver. I totally agree this situation is untenable and a true screw up, but I'd have expected a Professor to have a better 'solution' than angrily pointing at athletics like the standard EECS student would.   


Again, I don't begrudge this post, but its pretty widely accepted knowledge that athletic department budgets are separate and usually driven heavily by football. The stadium screw up is pretty suboptimal, but I am a little disappointed that we're basically seeing the same argument that fairly uninformed students sarcastically make in Soda Hall. To just back up these claims, here's an [SFGate article stating that no tuition money or state money would be provided for stadium payments.](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/UC-Berkeley-to-tap-academic-funds-to-help-bail-12330822.php) There also is an article showing that last year, [Cal football turned a 4.9 million profit, and basketball a low 6 figure profit](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/25/hotline-analysis-cal-athletics-turned-a-profit-in-fy20-thanks-to-a-massive-assist-from-central-campus/). It notably states that other sports lost Cal $17 million plus, which is fine since that's how most schools operate. But again, I just feel that Professor Weaver went for the easy punching bag of football since it would resonate rather than take these facts into consideration.
Our system basically boiled the frog (every other CS program of note has the department able to control through direct freshman admission so they never had this explosion), with an increase of ~100 students/year for a decade.  And we came up with a system that DOES work for scale, but it is a grind to run.  

Why do you think I've taught or co-taught 161 for 5 of the last 6 semesters?  Because if we lose 161 we lose the talent pipeline of TAs for that class and suddenly go into a situation where we have hundreds of students simply unable to graduate.  If you think a money deficit is bad, try an annual deficit of 700 upper division class seats/year when you need to provide 7500 just so students can graduate.

Give me the $ and I could keep the department running AT OUR CURRENT SCALE.  But it takes both money and will.  Since the department will never get the $, why bother cultivating the will?

According to this they are the same size right now
[deleted]
They can make it specific to the person. So it’s a simple lookup of who did intended cs and then only adding those people to permission.
Damn, Cal Basketball makes money?  Huh.
u/NicholasWeaver I do respect your opinion quite a bit. I'd like to better understand your logic here. Why bring up football as the benchmark? Was it simply lack of familiarity with the nuances of college football contracts?
I would imagine they’re mostly taken by transfers though, right? Since a lot of CS transfers end up with coursework that’s really similar to 70 or 61A/B/C but not technically articulable.
CS is just declared (mostly juniors and seniors) whereas EECS is all four years. So the CS cohorts are now ~2x the EECS cohorts, and they want them to go back to being smaller than the EECS cohorts (which will also shrink if they turn off CoE change of major).
> It’s quite funny because i know a ton of L&S CS Intended kids being absolutely railed and not meeting the 3.3 requirement while kids who put down math or MCB without thinking twice are still getting into the major. Just a thought

What does this have to do with anything? Yes, a good portion of people who didn't intend cs are smart enough to pass the requirement. They got into Berkeley for a reason. And yes, some people who got in for cs do poorly. This doesn't mean that it's still not a backdoor. 

As for the first point, I never said baring everybody from cs70 is a perfect solution because as always, there is a percentage of people that truly did have a change of heart about what they wanted to do. But with the number of people that try to declare cs without applying cs, there is no way that most of them didn't want cs to begin way. And if people didn't think that putting cs would hurt them, I don't understand why they would not put intended cs in the first place. If there is a reason, let me know and I'd be happy to change my mind.
Oh that’s great to hear and now that I think about it I recall the same thing with another department’s grad classes, idk why I thought this was impossible lol
Yeah blew my mind too
It is because of the scale.  In terms of the University budget this is a small amount.

Also it is because of viewed University priorities.  What you spend your money on is what you actually prioritize.  The chancellor had no problem providing the athletic department (a department that is supposed to be entirely self funding) with $20M in 2020, nor assuming $10M/yr in stadium debt.

Put bluntly, the University does NOT ACTUALLY CARE about undergraduate education, at least to the same degree it cares about the football team and all the proliferating deans.
Also if anyone here has taken these classes (specifically 47f) and could provide a bit more info about how they work that would be much appreciated
[deleted]
I mean not great to hear but yeah lol
I see where you’re coming from, and frankly agree that athletics should be self funding. Is this lack of university caring about education an issue with leadership or endemic throughout UC admin?
You keep trying to paint me as mad or riled up about a backdoor when all I am doing is having a conversation lmao. And yes, the ""I got mine"" mentality where I haven't mentioned how it affects me once. I hope you realize that no matter what decision they make, the cs department is still going to be underfunded and overcrowded while I'm there so it really isn't an ""I got mine"" mentality.

I just wanted to make one thing clear because I didn't actually read the original comment when I first commented. I agree that everyone who got admitted in 2022 should be able to try to declare if they want to because as I said earlier, one year of an extra 100-200 or however many students isn't going to make or break their cs department. And as I also said earlier, I know that a lot of people that don't get in intended cs are smart enough to major in cs at Berkeley. Doesn't mean it's right to put another major(messing up that department's numbers as a side effect) if you always planned to do cs.

Also, how many times are you going to dodge the question about why somebody would not put the intended cs if they thought it would have no bearing on their decision?

&#x200B;

Also hope there are no hard feelings. I like having these types of conversations so thanks 😀
yeah i meant if the department goes down this route, not having a black market for enrollment codes is great to hear but of course the entire situation is not what anyone wants in the first place...
I think it is endemic at any university that has a division I football team.  I suspect very few have athletic departments that actually make a profit, despite a business model focused on indentured servitude as a semi-pro farm-league for the NFL."
CDSS degrees will still be BAs,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13llzt5/cdss_degrees_will_still_be_bas/,2023-05-18 22:25:44,"[https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/may23/a3.pdf](https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/may23/a3.pdf)

I was reading through the proposal and found that the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society will be offering the following degrees:

• B.A. in Data Science

• B.A. in Computer Science

• B.A. in Statistics

• Ph.D. in Computational Biology (administered by the Center for Computational

Biology)

• Ph.D. in Computational Precision Health 

In addition to the above B.A. in Statistics, the Department of Statistics would administer:

• M.A. in Statistics

• Ph.D. in Statistics

In addition to the above B.A. in Computer Science, the Department of Electrical Engineering and

Computer Sciences would administer:

• M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science

• 5th-Year M.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences

• M.S. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science

The only other interesting thing is a chart of faculty cost and that they've managed to raise $516.7 million in total.

There is no info on the timeline for undergrad degrees, but they are recruiting faculty during the 2023-24 academic year.

I really want to know if I'll get to be in this college while at Berkeley lol.","Interesting observation. I wonder how they’ll handle current students with all this stuff. For example, if someone declares CS or DS next fall, are they going to be in L&S still? Or in CDSS?
[deleted]
[deleted]
M.S. in Data Science?
Finally there is a masters in Stats! From a Long-awaited Stats grad!
Why does B.A. vs B.S. matter?
So no more B.S. in EECS?
CDSS is only starting 25-26, so most students should be good. I think if someone is declared, they’ll move them to that college but it’ll probably be like Haas where the breadth is the same
I mean can u change majors within CDSS freely?
In their defense, we have a B.S. called Society & Environment
There's been a one-year full-time terminal masters program for at least 10 years
It doesn’t at all everyone is just being petty. No self respecting company hires based on if your degree is BA or BS, moreso the major and where it’s from.
B.A. usually requires a lot more humanities classes.
I believe since the major is also part of the COE it would retain its status as a BS
Where did it say 25-26? I thought that was just when the new building was opening? From the email the chancellor put out, it seems like this is going to be starting up fairly quickly
Wait so if i declare DS at the end of this year and graduate in ‘26 I’ll graduate from CDSS? How does it work if I’m double majoring with another L&S major?
Idk
The Haas degrees are BS degrees too
Glad to hear that.
You can tell how long ago did I graduate from Cal.
I saw it online in an article that Berkeley posted
No clue tbh, it’s so new no one knows logistics yet but I’m sure more information will come out soon
>The Haas degrees are BS degrees too

For Haas, that BS stands for Bullshit

Edit: ohh so you're just taking a bunch of classes before you graduate. Well, I bet they are lots of fun, but it still sure seems like a lot lol. Are there 3/4 out of this list that you REALLY want to take?
If you’re taking 188 for the sake of actual learning you should know that, at least in my opinion, 188 is one of those classes that’s incredibly easy to pass in but if you want to do well and learn, it takes a good amount of work. The concepts aren’t easy and actually taking the time to dig through the material takes a lot. I stopped trying a 3rd of the way through and still passed but learned nothing. This isn’t a class you can give PNP effort in and still learn.
Yes
You could also just email the prof to audit the courses you’re interested in

Would I be able to succeed at Berkeley EECS M.Eng (Cornell Undergrad)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/zr6a1r/would_i_be_able_to_succeed_at_berkeley_eecs_meng/,2022-12-20 17:21:55,"I’m thinking of applying to Berkeley’s EECS M.eng program to do a 5th year of school but having doubts it’s even worth doing so because I’m not sure I would be good enough to graduate (don’t consider whether it’s actually worth it). I’ve already been admitted to Cornell’s M.eng program which is basically just an extra year of undergrad similar to your 5th year masters.

I have a 3.3 GPA with a CS major GPA of around 3.0, with coursework being everything from basic intro to python to machine learning, algorithms, comp vision, and all the lots of 4000 level coursework. 

To be honest I know I’m not fully applying myself but I’m scared I won’t be able to make it even if I do. I don’t attend any classes and am not great about doing my own homework properly even though I know those are two things I can do, so I basically just learn everything before the exams. I just feel like im not smart enough when it comes to those exams though, so I haven’t been super motivated to be more diligent about applying myself.

Meng here is not a super challenging program (mostly for ppl with visa stuff/ want the Berkeley name, programmer is a cash cow for Uni)- courses you'll take are probably not gonna be super hard grade-wise, wouldn't worry too much about it."
what makes engineering here so good?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14ldggy/what_makes_engineering_here_so_good/,2023-06-28 09:04:36,"im not trying to discredit the university as the title may suggest. i want to know, how can i best take advantage of the resources the university offers?

for context, im a rising soph, female + poc, studying mechanical eng. i have enjoyed the classes so far but everything else has not impressed me. 

the makerspace is way too expensive to buy a pass every semester (i don’t qualify for finaid). this makes me sad because there were multiple free options at ucla and purdue for example.

the student teams seemed super cool at first (especially steel bridge and concrete canoe) but it fuckin sucks that the space they have is so far away (richmond!) also the car/rocketry teams seem super disorganized. ik student teams are huge at mich so that’s another letdown.

is research an option? ive never really heard of meceng research (at least any that is simple enough for someone my level), mostly just cs and bio for entry level stuff but im happy to be educated.

long post but thank u if u read all the way! im paying a lot so really trying to make the best of berkeley.","I think Berkeley Engineering is only as good as you make it. I feel like if you’re looking for negative things in the program you will find them. I speak from experience as I also felt the same way at the end of my first year. Persistence is key. It took some experimentation and trial and error before I found a research group I enjoyed. I clearly remember being very disappointed in the student groups I joined early on in my Berkeley experience, but I kept looking around until I found things that meshed well with me. It’s a very trial and error process (in my experience). For context I am a ChemE. 

As for your question about research, generally there won’t be research options that are simple enough for you to understand this early on in your studies, but that’s okay! My research experiences were way over my head but that’s very normal. I think if you really are interested in research (which was my major interest in school) you should try to find a group you are passionate about and dive in head first. Go get your ass kicked. I loved the challenge and I think it really forces you to go a little beyond your textbook studies and is super beneficial. 

Hope this kind of helps. It’s a bit of a difficult thing to give you one straight forward answer cause everyone is different. My best advice is try not to get too discouraged (I know that’s super hard). Keep looking and you will find what you’re looking for. Don’t feel bad about “wandering” and feeling a little “lost.” It’s intimidating seeing all these people that seem to have everything figured out since they were three years old, but don’t mind that. Not all who wander are lost. Hope this helps.
There's a free makerspace in Moffitt https://makerspace.berkeley.edu/ and supernode in Cory https://supernode.berkeley.edu/ Also the MechE machine shop in Etcheverry is legit world class and free also, though you need a legit reason to get the training first, but after you're trained you can use it whenever. A lot of other schools don't even have a machine shop, let alone our amazing technicians to help you out. Also if you're part of a research group or student club that needs a makers pass they'll cover the cost so it'll be free for you to use Jacobs/Citris that way.

There's so many student teams here surely not all of them are disorganized or go to richmond? But yes a lot of them require a lot of dedication. The people that get the most out of them usually spend a ton of time on the club. I understand the struggle cuz personally I never stuck with those clubs either but I personally wasn't really interested in design so it was more just a stepping stone for me anyway. Everyone I know that was properly dedicated to those clubs (including going to Richmond) got amazing job offers because of the experience they had. Plus you can't expect that other schools don't still have similar issues. The grass is always greener... 

If you haven't heard of MechE research idk you're living under a rock lol? Ok well it'll likely come up a lot more when you're an upperclassmen and you know more people doing research and aiming for grad school. https://me.berkeley.edu/research-areas-and-major-fields/ if you click on a topic, it'll show you the professors/labs within that field. Obviously some labs are gonna be too theoretical to join but there are definitely labs that take freshman and sophomores and you start out kinda doing basic tasks until you learn more. When I first joined a lab I was just 3d printing a bunch of parts, but hey that got me a free makers pass. The research here is really a big thing that sets it apart from other schools, we do a lot of very influential work and the professors here are legit famous in their academic realm. I had plenty of friends do research but it's also not essential, not everyone needs to do research. It depends on your career goals. But my friends who did got into top grad programs either here or at places like MIT, Caltech, Stanford, CMU, etc.

Also the classes do make a big difference. I had a friend at UCLA that came here for grad school and said comparatively the UCLA classes were a joke. And I had friends at other schools that basically just only had classes where they build stuff and like didn't even take thermo till their last semester, which is a sophomore class here. And when me and my friends went to grad school we were really well prepared. A lot of students from other schools that come here for grad school are behind. They have to start off in some of our undergrad classes because at their undergrad school that class was graduate level so they haven't taken them. I also have friends that went to like Stanford for grad school and said the classes there are a joke compared to Berkeley too. I interned at JPL after junior year and I was properly able to contribute and work with the people there even though they all had PhDs (not saying I was on their level at all, just that I had learned a lot of advanced stuff in my classes). They only hired 2 people for that program, me and someone from MIT.

I think part of the issue is just not knowing all the opportunities out there. There's also so many companies that come recruit here it's ridiculous and they have infosessions and other networking events. My friend at Columbia was asking if most people here get engineering jobs and I'm like yeah why?? And she said almost everyone she knows ends up working in finance just cuz what's big in New York so that's what most companies are recruiting for.

Another thing is just the people you're around are so talented and high achieving, it really helps you excel. I had a friend at my internship that said almost no one she knew at her school was even doing an internship, whereas for Berkeley basically everyone I knew was doing an internship. A lot of people at other schools just go through classes and then graduate and look for a job with legit no experience and it's rough. Basically everyone I knew had a job lined up before graduating (unless they were going to grad school) and those that didn't, was just because they hadn't looked yet and they got jobs within a few months of graduating.

Plus you can't always think the grass is greener elsewhere, everywhere has issues that the students are gonna complain about. I think it's just easy to glamorize a place before you've actually been there. Also you're comparing us to other top tier engineering schools so of course there's not gonna be some huge difference. The difference is gonna be more obvious if you compare us to most of the rest of the universities in America. But obviously Michigan and Purdue and UCLA are also amazing schools with good opportunities, so I wouldn't expect there to be some big glaring differences that make the experience so black and white. But even people at private schools with tons of funding like Caltech or USC etc have plenty of complaints about their program or the administration etc so I think it's best not to idolize schools because everywhere has issues. 

Anyway I'm also a mechE girl (alum), hope this helped, best of luck.
I did MechE there and got a lot out of joining clubs like Berkeley Innovation and PTS. I think there is a directory of student organizations somewhere, just find a few that look interesting and go to some meetings to see what sticks. 

I also started doing research during my sophomore year and by my senior year I was co-director of my lab. Just find a professor whose research interests you and talk to them. They're always looking for more free labor.

Edited at add stuff: Another thing that was great about engineering at Berkeley was meeting some of the smartest people I've ever known. I think I learned as much from my friends there as I did from my professors. Find the smartest people you can and surround yourself with them, they're usually pretty fun too.
Well. Uc Berkeley is number 1 in civil engineering undergrad. We have an absolute spectacular civil engineering lab, and many of my profs were leading ground breaking work. I assume the mechanical engineering department has a pretty cool lab too?
No offense OP but you must’ve been living under a rock 😭😭
I'm a ChemE alum (female + poc) and I ended up switching to big-tech product management after graduating. I think berkeley engineering is a unique experience. It's a really big, diverse school compared to MIT or Stanford and its also a campus that's integrated into the city. I think a lot of top engineering schools are siloed with less exposure to the community. I felt at Berkeley that you're still part of the real world in some sense (even if it doesn't feel that way with school). Also having large class sizes for engineering also helps you understand where you stand - its often a reality check for people who were top of their class in high school to be surrounded by so many bright, talented people. There are lots of opportunities and cutting edge research happening the Bay Area across disciplines. Networking isn't handed to you- you've got to make the effort but the opportunities are there. In my experience, Berkeley engineers have a lot of tenacity, grit, and realism that I see lacking from other top engineering schools (particularly the private ones). Enjoy your experience and don't be too hard on yourself- you're not going to be able to do everything in college!
why are you paying for a Makers Pass when there are free makers spaces? Also, as an ME student you have access to the [Mechanical Engineering Student Access Machine Shop](https://me.berkeley.edu/resources/student-machine-shop/).   

There are  [ME resources](https://me.berkeley.edu/resources/) for you but you have to be very proactive seeking those opportunities and resources.   

URAP Fall application opens on 8/16.   Listings for undergrad research projects will begin late July so be on the lookout for opportunites.   There were several [ME specific projects](https://urapprojects.berkeley.edu/list.php?keywords=&category=&faculty_department=Mechanical+Engineering&status=&hours=&site=&sort=faculty_last_name&submit=submit) listed for Spring 23 you may find interesting. 

Lastly, comparison is the thief of joy so stop doing yourself a disservice and start focusing on what you can do to make your experience here a positive and rewarding one for you.
As someone who spent time on the car team(s) and the rocketry team(s) during my tenure I won't lie they are tragically disorganized (which unfortunately makes them not as competitive as some other teams) but a lot of this comes from a lack of support from the university (and a myriad of other reasons but I don't really want to get into it because it's been awhile since I've been on the teams)

If you came to Berkeley purely for the project teams and DIY stuff, you're going to be sorely disappointed. But I'd wager if you came to Berkeley Engineering for the complete package, this is still one of the best in the world at it, I pull from my Berkeley experience all the time in my professional career and while I don't mean to toot my own horn here, I've heard from leadership on several occasions that engineers from Berkely are ""a cut above"" engineers from a lot of other schools.

Reach out to me in DMs if you want to discuss things I'd be happy to go more in depth, for all it's (glaring) flaws, I still pretty much bleed blue and gold.

Appreciate the great answer!  As long as it is not breaking a Reddit rule would you be a open to a call with my daughter who is entering a Mech Eng degree this year (2024) with offers to Purdue, UIUC, UCB, Santa Clara and a number of others.  Purdue impressed with both quality of program, general camaraderie on campus, fantastic industry connections and opportunities while Berkeley has the (just slight!) edge on cultural interest and location but a significant edge in global reputation.  Berkeley does however have a reputation as cut-throat competition, though I am not sure that is real or merely a projection from the lower performing students.  My daughter has Grad School ambitions….Much appreciated.

ill agree! these replies have rly opened my eyes (but thats what i was hoping for :)) i dont have many friends in my major so i thought this would be the best place to ask
wanted to come back to this and say thanks :) this has rly helped me this summer more than u would realize so thank u!!
this is what i was hoping to hear, thank u! i did ultimately choose berkeley to become a better engineer so i would love to hear ur thoughts in private :)
Unfortunately no checked in with the moffitt staff last sem but apparently it got moved to doe or somewhere
It's definitely not cutthroat at all, that seems to be a myth spread amongst high school kids. Collaboration is essential in engineering, we all work together on hw and to study for tests, and I'd get lots of advice from older students about internships/research etc. We had a great camaraderie because we struggled through the classes together lol. I think maybe CS could be somewhat competitive cuz there's just so many students, but I found MechE students and other engineering majors pretty chill and friendly.

It's definitely very challenging and people are high achieving, so it's important not to try to compare yourself or expect yourself to get straight As or something. I think that should be the mentality at either school because college and engineering is just so much more difficult than high school, and a lot of students that go to top universities are used to getting perfect grades and having classes feel relatively easy for them. Some students can get insecure or feel imposter syndrome because other students at these top schools seem to be doing so many impressive things. College will take some adjustment as she gets used to having to learn how to study accordingly and juggle new things. 

Berkeley has lots of opportunities and industry connections as well. Both schools are excellent and either would be a great choice really.
Yeah for sure
lmao sorry idk how to stop. tldr we have great clubs, makerspaces, recruiting, classes, research etc. and the people I know ended up in awesome jobs and grad schools. Our graduates end up being very competent and well prepared compared to many schools. OP is comparing top notch schools, so there's not gonna be vast differences, though she still hasn't seen all that Berkeley has to offer. But of course every place has plenty of issues and things we can complain about so just don't fall into the trap of idolizing schools and thinking the grass is so much greener elsewhere.

Is my freshman schedule ok?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15c7t5j/is_my_freshman_schedule_ok/,2023-07-28 13:10:32,"Hello. I am planning to major MCB w Premed track. I got lucky and was able to register all the classes I planned, but now I am having a second thought. Is this doable or should I remove one class and replace w 1-2 unit decal? 
I had 5s on AP Cal BC, BIO, LANG and LIT, but I didn’t take AP Chem in high school.
I am willing to try first if it’s doable so please advise with any study tips. 
Thank you in advance.

Math 1A -4 units
Bio 1B - 4 units
Chem 1A -3 units
Chem 1AL -2 units
Eng R1A -4 units (total 17 units)","there’s really no need to take this many classes, especially for your first semester. chem will probably take up a lot of time considering you didn’t take AP chem. you should be fine in math, but english can also have a high workload depending on the instructor. i would recommend dropping bio 1b and taking that sophomore year… it’s not an especially hard class, but requires a good amount of memorization. plus the 4 hr labs suck
It’s kind of a shame you want to repeat Eng R&C classes even though you got a 5 in Lit, but I understand your predicament.  An option you can do is to take a R1A/R1B combo online next summer.  This would go from early June-end of August.  There are a handful of CCC’s that offer this combo online, mostly in the LA area.  Rio Honda is one of them IIRC. Or maybe take a more advanced Rhetoric class. 

Similarly, an option you can do instead of taking Math 1A  and 1B again is to take Math 54 Linear Algebra.  This might look more impressive to med schools rather than repeating a course. 

Having said all this, “repeating” courses could be good for padding your GPA. As such I don’t see a big issue with taking 17 units.  You can drop one if you’re overwhelmed, but given the 5’s that you got you should be able to handle those classes.
Do Math 1B + Stat 2 if you got a 5 on BC since it covers the one year of math requirement. Choose R5A > R1A, since less work is required and the latter is affiliated with the English Department, which is harder.
Is Eng R1A a requirement for MCB w premed? I thought you can skip R1A with AP Lit score of 4+? If you are able to drop/skip Eng R1A then your schedule is doable.
I totally agree! I was in OP’s situation and was consumed with just math and chem. bio 1b is dry and tedious and can be taken later. for the premed english req, try to find a class with a high avg final grade on berkeleytime. r1b can be a toss up.
Since I got 5 on Lang and Lit, I am exempt for 2 semesters of Eng. But because Premed(most med schools) requires 1 year College English/writing, I decided to do Eng R1a and R1b(next semester). Does English course have a lot of assignments?
If didn’t take AP Chem then could take a look at Chem 32 (2 units) to go along with chem 1a.
I’m taking R1B at CCC now since it’s not a major requirement. Taking at CCC is much easier but only the credits count not the grade.

I read Colwrit, Com Lit, and Eng are ‘harder’ ones compared to the other R&C subject courses. If you are into culture then Film R1A or Scand R5A are lot more interesting and usually lighter load. These just examples. Look at what you are interested in and do a search of the course on this subreddit. Most should be very doable, fun, and easier."

UGBA 10 (3 units, L&S breadth requirement)

ENG R1A (4 units, R&C A requirement)




Thanks y'all in advance!","If you’re only taking ugba 10 for the breadth requirement then I would maybe recommend taking another class instead
fine. take an easy R1A if you can. who is teaching 1A?
Totally doable
If I want to take a schedule like this with math 54 instead of math 1A is it still doable?
Thank you for your comment! Actually, I'm taking UGBA 10 because it is really something that piques my interest, and I always wanted to explore Business administration while at college! It is just so happens to be also the class that satisfies L&S breadth, sorry if I worded my post ambiguously! Have a great day!
yes just be on top of your game in absorbing completely new material (if you haven't learned linear alg/diff eq before).
There are better business classes to take this one sucks. It sounds really cool but you don’t learn anything except for the finance module, which is just a repeat of what you learn in Econ 1. It’s a weeder class for haas people so not the best class to take for interests. But at end of day do what you wanna do. I just hated this class
Thanks for your input! Do you think it is better to take econ 1 instead of UGBA 10 for me? I was actually considering both of these classes, as they both satisfy breadth req. Thanks in advance!
I thought Econ 1 was a very interesting class, a lot more applicable knowledge to real life, and grading was a lot more holistic. For ugba your grade is 80% midterms, and they’re terribly designed multiple choice tests. Econ midterms basically ask you questions and you have to write to explain yourself, so much easier to get partial credit but can be harder if you’re not good at that type of test. The other person said it’s a weeder class, which I suppose it technically is but it’s not as hard as most classes labeled as weeder, and is probably the most general low level economics class you could take. I can’t speak on any other teachers, but if Jim Campbell is teaching it for your semester he’s an amazing instructor."

Data 100 & CS 161 are options
The easiest course is CogSci 131 which is basically 10 Python exercises and nothing much else. I would say Bio C131, Data 144 (for most CS majors), and Info 159 along with the aforementioned Ling 100 would all be relatively easy.  Edit:  do note that I am saying these are easy classes in general - some/all of these classes are not offered for Spring or potentially are already full.

I’m somewhat surprised that Data C104 is allowed since it’s a non-technical class, an ethics class.  Do note that it potentially fulfills a breadth as well. 

Do note that for you LSCS majors who started at Berkeley on or after Fall 2022, another CS class cannot be used to fulfill the CS technical elective."

Just wondering if anyone has any experience with these classes? Or if someone that has taken 186, can say how much of the material taught in 101 they’re familiar with? Thanks!","for future peeps, ended up taking both this semester. just take 186. there's a decent bit of overlap and 186 goes much more in depth.
186 goes into the depths of how a DB system is built. Data 101 is more concerned with using databases to build data pipelines etc. if you want to go into software engineering take 186 else take 101
CS 186 will teach you SQL and mongoDB for \~4 weeks. That is the only practical component. The rest of the class is about database implementation."

Is MET significantly harder to gain acceptance to than EECS?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vlel9u/is_met_significantly_harder_to_gain_acceptance_to/,2022-06-26 14:12:51,"Hey so I'm new to the college app process, and was wondering if I should apply to MET as EECS/Business OR if I should play it safer (?) and apply to just EECS in the eng school, and have the BA in CS in the College of L&S as my second choice major.

I'd really like to study both business and EECS in MET but I think my top priority is just gaining acceptance to Berkeley, so studying in the dual-degree MET program isn't the top priority if it's much harder to get into than EECS (I'm a CA resident btw).

Really would appreciate any insight/tips.","If you don't make MET they will still consider you for just the EECS major.
they will drop you into the regular engineering consideration pile if you dont make the cut for met. just go for met >:) go big or gob ears
MET falls back to EECS automatically, so if you're interested, I'd suggest you do that. Besides special programs like this, Berkeley doesn't have second choice majors, so if you chose EECS first choice, you wouldn't be able to choose L&S CS anyway.
Normally, I’d say that if getting into Berkeley is foremost, just apply for L&S CS (you wouldn’t have a chance at MET, but it would be a surer shot at Cal). However, they happened to take far less people who put L&S CS intended this year (the rate was equivalent to EECS and this was strange because they usually don’t curb specific majors in L&S). I’d wait to see if there are any changes in policy over the next few months because there likely will be, and it would affect what you may choose.
FWIW I applied to MET and didn't get in but got into EECS.
hey, thanks for the reply. I thought Cal doesn't admit by major in L&S? Why would they curb CS this year without notifying applicants about the change in policy?
Normally they don’t, correct. I’m not sure why they did it this year, but I heard that some professor or someone acknowledged that they offered admission to a much lower proportion of applicants who put CS in L&S as their intended major, and did so without informing anyone. Technically it’s their right to do so, although it is pretty unethical. Not sure what they will do next year."

As you can imagine, walking back and forth is a pain in the ass and it got to the point where I was like, “fuck it” and spent a good part of my first semester living in Main Stacks(I only left to eat.).

My parents and I eventually decided that enough was enough and I got a bicycle. The commute was much quicker(20-30 minutes to go to campus from my apartment) but, unfortunately, my bicycle got stolen.

Fortunately, I was able to save up some money from my side hustles(investing in Brazilian piranha trade, money laundering and arms trafficking), so I pulled some strings and purchased a Chengdu J-20 🐉 from [redacted for security purposes].

And, boy, let me tell you: My life got SO much easier. The commute was LITERALLY a matter of seconds.

If you got Moderna you most likely don’t need a booster shot. The doseage is 200 micrograms compared to Pfizer’s 60 micrograms. In addition the moderna shot had a longer interval time between the shots which helps for immunity. 

If you are immunocompromised a booster shot would be helpful. 
If you got the Pfizer or J&J it might be helpful as well. 
If you got the Moderna, the current research says a booster shot doesn’t significantly help, as the dosage is a lot higher than the other shots. 

Stay informed!","I'm too lazy to pull up articles but there's some evidence that moderna efficacy drops after 6-8 months too, albeit less than the other vaccines.

On a side note, the drop in efficacy is just for antibodies, which to my understanding are shorter-term sources of immunity. You retain T-cell immunity. So vaccine protection against infection and mild symptoms fades, but your body can still ramp up antibody production much faster than if you had been unvaccinated, so vaccines should remain protective against severe disease for significantly longer.

I'm getting my booster tomorrow, but getting boosted isn't really *as* important as getting vaccinated to begin with as far as I know.
Everyone should get a booster regardless of what vaccine they got originally, it's really is as simple as that.

having the same issue engaging for visibility lol
I'm guessing that from the seats they won't be able to see the actual person on stage as there will be something obstructing their view.
now that I'm thinking about it, I think it might be lateral view rather than front view which is why they're saying ""no stage view"""
Be honest; What should I do to get into Berkeley?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1c04c6v/be_honest_what_should_i_do_to_get_into_berkeley/,2024-04-09 14:50:03,"Hey chat! I'm currently a junior (second semester) in highschool with substantial aspirations to go to UC Berkeley. I know it's not end all be all as I plan on probably settling for in-state if I end up not getting in, however dreaming big doesn't hurt. I understand that distinctive essays, PIQs, ECs, and an overall exceptional academic performance is pretty much the basis requirement but I honestly just feel a little insecure comparing myself.

My very personal reasoning to my drive to this school is to literally leave my hometown (I know this isn't valid enough, bear with me I'm desparate), to gain new experiences, and (being transparent) to earn the prestige. My overall reasoning would be the fact that UC Berkeley can offer a more challenged but creative course that'd overall contribute to my innovation skills and it'd introduce me to a larger, more in-tune with my life ambitions, social setting. From UC Berkeley, I hope to take away skills in strategic business and apply that to marginalized communities that may not receive the benefits of a dependable/prolific launchpad. Although these skills could be picked up from other schools, UC Berkeley has proved to me to be most alligned with myself and somewhat attainable.

I think sharing this, you can probably guess I'm aiming for Haas School of Business with a major in something business (administration, entrepreneurship, innovation, idk yet). Wanted to ask what you guys think I should do/involve myself in while I still have like 1.5 years left of high school? Is there anything I should just drop? And just answer literally **any** **advice** on how to hack the system tbh !! ALSO PLEASE PUT **SCHOLARSHIP OPPORTUNITIES** !!

Adding my stats just in case lol (these are as of end of first sem, year 3):

Weighted GPA: 4.234

Unweighted GPA: 3.754

Completed Credit Hrs: 39.0

Class rank: top 150 out of like 800

SAT: 1310 (I know UC Berkeley doesn't consider anymore)

ACT: n/a

Classes chosen for next year are: AP CS, VU Finite Math, VU Eng Comp/Lit, Accounting Fundementals, AP Stat, Marketing Fundementals, Strategic Marketing

Relevant past classes: AP Lang, VU Amer Hist, all honors classes + up to Spanish III credit, PLTW Business Management, PLTW Biomedical Science + PLTW Human Body Systems (at some point I was very much a science person and it's not that I don't like it, I'm just passionate about other things but I don't mind doing science since I do well \~ earned Science Student of the Month!)

Extracurriculars: Board for a club with the purpose of global service and philanthropy (helped in starting it freshmen year), NHS, NSHSS, S.T.E.M. tutoring, regular tutoring, D.E.C.A., Pre-Medical Club, Mentor to incoming freshmen, an adequate amount of volunteer work for local non-profits and my church 

I'm first generation immigrant Asian child with parents from a third-world country who is also prioritizing academics, I know there's basically an infinite amount of competiton but don't diminish my hopes and dreams please lmfao. I'm willing to do what it takes but maybe not sell my soul lol.

Thank you for your time and efforts. They're very much appreciated.

\- Siren","Got to a community college for 2 years, then transfer to a 4 year
Top 150/800 as an OOS second semester junior seems rough ngl, especially with nothing super spectacular on the college app. Not saying not to be hopeful, but it isn’t very likely.

Also, NSHSS is a scam.
isn’t national honor society a scam lmao
An OOS student with a 3.75 gpa? Not much you can do except pray and apply to UCR as well
gonna be honest with you, being oos and asian will be big, big hurdles.  there's really not much else you can do from an academic standpoint.  your stats are already pretty impressive, and you don't have to worry about the SAT score since Berkeley won't consider it.  the only thing you have in your control at this point are your essays.  you're going to have to ernest hemingway your way to berkeley.  start now and really dig deep into your life and passions, and how you're going to use cal's resources to enhance them and make the world better.  sounds corny, but they eat that up.
If youre aiming for haas you need a higher gpa
Basically you need to convey both why you’re exceptional and need Berkeley, specifically, to attain your goals.
One thing rich kids do is hire people to help improve their essays.  I know because I have seen it.  The only advice I can give there is you want your essays to show your specific interest in Berkeley in particular and create a compelling narrative that makes you stand out.

  
Also look at fall back schools that are not as competitive but still in the Bay Area (or LA too if you want to go there) etc.  

The California State University system has a bunch of schools all over CA. 

  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California\_State\_University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_University)
Rn, your biggest hurdle is that, to get into Haas as an OOS, you’ll probably want better states (3.75 unweighted and 150/180 are probably below the average for admits). I don’t think Berkeley looks at rank directly (I could be wrong on that), but colleges will usually have data on your school (so they’d probably know what a typical GPA for your school is as well as the general GPA distribution), so they’ll have at least a rough idea of how you stand against your class. Considering that you’re in second semester junior year and Berkeley will only see your 9-11 grade GPA (won’t see first semester senior grades), there probably isn’t much you can do other than do as best as you can this semester and maybe do some summer courses or something. If you could get up to 120/800 (top 15%) or 80/800 (top 10%) before start of Senior year, that could help. However, at this point I’m assuming that’s probably either impossible or extremely impractical, so I wouldn’t worry about it.

The best thing you can do to get the best marginal increase in your chances is probably ECs, ideally something outside of school. Your ECs seem really cool and I’m sure they’re things you’re passionate about and enjoy, but I’m not sure if any of them would stand out too much. The best thing you can probably do at this point (since you basically have a summer left) is to either do an internship relevant to your major (tho I’d assume most applications for those have ended) or start a project or a business or something. I think the latter might be better, because whatever ECs you do don’t necessarily need to be “prestigious”, but it helps if it distinguishes you from other applicants. There’s a lot of applicants who do tutoring or start clubs (not diminishing the effort you’ve probably put into those tho), so anything you can do that makes you stand out from the thousands of other applicants will be good.

Beyond that, make sure to put a lot of effort on your essays. A lot of people underestimate the importance of essays, but essays can honestly be what gets people in in some cases. I know a guy who had basically zero CS ECs, but got into UIUC CS (out of state) over people from my schools with much more CS experience; obviously I can’t say why exactly, but I do know that he was probably the best writer in my school, so my best guess is his essays were what put him ahead.

Last thing I’ll add is to not over think things too much. The whole college app process is kind of a crapshoot. I know two guys that founded a company as high schoolers with over >1M in VC funding and got rejected Berkeley this year, and I know people who did… frankly jack shit for all of HS, and got in. There’s so many variables, many of them highly subjective, that there’s no exact science to say who will get in and who won’t. Regardless of what anyone here says, you *can* absolutely get accepted; you obviously shouldn’t *expect* to get accepted (not as an insult to you, just that almost no one should assume they’ll get accepted to Berkeley OOS, especially Haas), but you shouldn’t assume you’ll get rejected. I’ll bet money that weaker applicants than you have been accepted, and stronger applicants than you have been rejected. You really just gotta take your shot and see how it goes, and I wish you the best of luck.
People in here need to pull their head out of their asses lol. I got in as an OOS Asian kid with relatively similar stats, but a way worse GPA and more extracurriculars. I was lucky to have a good test score but that doesn’t even damn near make up for the hole in my GPA. Focus on writing your essays about something you’re actually passionate about and find something in your extracurriculars that demonstrates your ambition. There’s a reason that thousands of bots with perfect GPAs and millions of Key Club hours get rejected: they don’t actually care about any of the work they do. Everything reads as a ploy to get into good schools, and admissions officers see that. Just be yourself and show them how much you care, and whatever happens happens; college is a crapshoot anyway, just make the best of it. Good luck man rooting for you!
If your gpa is there you need exceptional essays and a passion that you show in those essays. Uc also loves to hear about personal growth and interesting stories that reflect how you are an individual and will stand out in college

Those are words from a former uc admissions officer that was a substitute teacher I had a few times.

Also dont make the admissions officer feel stupid, ie dont start an essay with a definition
Make sure you proof read your personal essay to the nth degree. Your writing is your writing. Your story is your story. But your spelling is Merriam-Webster's. So it's Fundamental and not Fundementals. Your punctation is Chicago Manual of Style. So semicolons, and not commas, separate independent clauses.

Work your ass off knowing full well that if you get admitted then you'll work even harder.
Hey man, same situation, same year, same target school. If you want to talk or share anything feel free to pm me :)
If you don’t get in as a freshman, go to a community college and complete the IGETC and pre-work for your desired major. They have transfer admissions programs to help. I went to DVC and got into every UC I applied to. I got my degree from Cal like everybody else.
Play more Lego Fortnite



But, to be serious, I think you're on the right track. You seem to be a bit scattered with respect to extracurriculars...are you able to dedicate enough time for the extracurriculars you care about/are passionate about?

For me, I felt like my leadership positions helped me the most with being admitted to EECS. However, GPA is definitely the most important factor from what I know. I wouldn't overflow extracurriculars if it sacrifices the GPA (I know some people might disagree with this).

Overall though, I would try to narrow and focus your extracurriculars and try to get leadership experience.

I don't really know about a lot of scholarships except this one: [https://alumni.berkeley.edu/get-involved/scholarships/the-leadership-award/](https://alumni.berkeley.edu/get-involved/scholarships/the-leadership-award/)
Continue doing your best and don’t get discouraged if you don’t get in straight out of high school. You basically need to be close to perfect academically at least on paper. If you don’t get in and you 100% want to go to Cal and only Cal, transfer from a CC.
What is vu?
First thing I’d do is stop calling it ‘UCB.’ Disgraceful.
Improve your gpa, you should be in the top 10% of students. See if you can talk to an UCB counselor
Bruh idk do your best but there are many places you can go that are not your hometown.
have a story; mine was the fact that i failed my freshman math but ended senior year w an A in calculus 3 and a passion for math. you need to show that you will be successful there, so pick something your passionate about and build your application around it. ur piqs are super important too so get a head start on them this summer
Are you applying for Spieker?
Also, I have to say, dont think Cal is your end all be all for schools, there are plenty of good schools for your undergrad, frankly i wouldn't worry about where you go for your undergrad too much as your MBA will be more important, focus on job prospects, a CSU is a very good option for career minded majors like business for your undergrad, and plenty of vary good CSUs, also plenty of good UCs as well, like the under-appreciated UC Merced
Learn to shoot 3 pointers at a 40% clip and run an offense, maybe take your team to the second round of state playoffs with strong assist numbers and good point of attack defense.
ur gpa sat and class rank suck tbh
a california community college \* if you want to go to a UC
I’m pretty sure that’s NSHSS or something like that, NHS is a club at my school

Edit: My bad completely missed the second part of ecs
But don’t read like a classics novel at the same time
OOS is a mixed bag with the UCs it occasibally helps cause the budget. Asian doesn't matter, we are barred from considering race 
Does that work? I’d be super put off as an AO hearing some kid say “hey I NEED to go here” lol
Liked your response but saying people did jack shit for all of high school and got in just sounds ridiculous. You are not these people and you are not living their lives. Most likely you did not see every single aspect of their applications/essays nor are you an admissions officer with any sort of qualification to judge weaker applicants from stronger applicants.
Honestly the light of hope I needed. Thank you, let me know about any other specific obstacles that you had to overcome (being OOS) or anything that helped you find a way to stand out.
seconding this! also an oos asian student!
Would being an OOS ~> CA CC ~> UC be the better option?
Leadership is a key element in Berkeley applicants but I guess in my area, we don't place as much emphasis on it. What would be approachable leadership positions that would matter? Like more leadership roles in clubs or just gaining experiences in management?
it's like college credit for in-state. realizing it's possibly irrelevant now but still decided to place it on there. would ap classes be the better choice?
changed just for you ;)
I was wondering if applying straight away would be the best move. I feel hesitant jumping the gun so I want to put myself in a better position first.
I'll definitely keep CSU in mind. Not trying to be the stereotypical ""I wanna be in Cali"" crowd but I genuinely think it would help and give me the type of experience/education I'm looking for. Also could be giving myself a death wish but hey! We all start somewhere.
Ehhhh, jack shit might’ve been an exaggeration, but I’m pretty confident I know what was on their app cause I saw their app (ECs and essays). I mean obviously it’s very subjective, it could’ve literally just been that the AO thought their essays were really good. But overall fair point, I’m not an AO so I can’t really judge.
third-ing this as well! yes stats are obv really important but i def got in not because of my gpa (as international/asian). my outside work was pretty good and i really conveyed that into my essays. i know one of the admissions and they really do see ur app holistically. please dont be discouraged and if anything u can do, do more community based experience, one that u truly give a shit about. i think alot of ca schools (not just uc) eat that shit up <3 wherever you’ll be im sure you’ll do great :) berkeley/not!
Yes. Check out the UCB transfer guide, they have a specific section for Haas.
low-key just rise up the ranks in clubs
You’ve got a great shot to get in now
If your not a california resident then dont go to a UC, unless you want to pay over 48k in tuition, and thats just your first year"

You’ll have to add that extra class at Adjustment time in 2nd week of August, whereupon you can go up to 20.5 units.  Do note that there’s a strategy in which to add an extra class at Adjustment time - you’ll want to save the class that is least likely to fill up for the Adjustment period.

Do note that if you go over 20.5, you will need approval from you college advisor.  Not sure how they would feel about a first term freshman taking more than 20.5 though.

Course reviews for fall 2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rnq16c/course_reviews_for_fall_2021/,2021-12-24 08:49:08,"For the benefit of students who want to know more about these courses (since I would’ve liked to know more about them before enrolling, and Reddit was my main research tool), below are my reviews for the classes I took this fall.

IND ENG 142 (or IEOR 142): 8/10

- Please note that this course does not really require IND ENG 165 as a prerequisite. I didn’t take it (although I had taken DATA 100, which probably helped) and it really had no impact on me.
- I took the course with Professor Grigas, who was a good lecturer even though the lectures were online (synchronous, but attendance not required).
- The course grade, for this semester at least, was based on 5 homework assignments (lowest dropped), a midterm, and a final project. The homework can take anywhere from 5 to 8 hours to complete, which is fair. The midterm was challenging but mostly fair. The final project was cool because it allowed us to form our own groups and do modeling on any topic we wanted. However, the staff, for as good as they were previously, provided no clear rubric and seemed to be pretty harsh with the grading, and the grades were released the day grades were submitted to the registrar, so no regrades whatsoever. A bit unfair if you ask me.
- As far as material goes, I mainly learned about linear regression, logistic  regression, classification and regression trees, random forests, and boosting. There were certainly other topics, but there was less of a focus on them (e.g. time series, regularization, sentiment analysis). I appreciated the pace of this material, as it wasn’t all crammed together and each topic took its time.
- Discussion was online and synchronous (there was also an in-person section), but I never attended any and just reviewed the code after it was released, and I did fine.
- The course requires you to know or learn Python, so if for whatever reason you are unfamiliar with Python, I’d recommend learning the basics before taking the course. With that said, much of the important code is given to you.
- Overall, highly recommend this course!
- Workload: 3-4 hours a week

IND ENG 172 (or IEOR 172): 7/10

- I took this with Professor Righter, so keep this in mind, as different professors probably run the course differently
- MATH 53 is not really necessary to understand this course for Professor Righter. 
- Definitely go to the lectures (in-person), otherwise you’re dead. Righter’s lectures can be a bit messy, but she’s very smart and she’ll always endeavor to answer your questions. Overall a good lecturer.
- The textbook is ass and you shouldn’t bother reading it.
- The grade is based on around 12 semi-weekly problem sets, two midterms, and a final. The problem sets range from super easy to “pain in the ass”, but there are more of the former than the latter. They seem to be graded on completion. The midterms and final were much easier than the problem sets, and they were very fair. You even get to submit your own problems to be put on the exams! I got my problems on every single exam, so I got a bunch of free points.
- The discussion sections were helpful, although I stopped going to them because they’re not really worth the 1-hour total walk for me. This didn’t really impact my performance in the class, and they certainly weren’t mandatory.
- Overall a highly manageable probability course, and a good professor. Would recommend.
- Workload: 5 hours a week 

EPS 50: 8/10

- This review is just for the iteration run by Professor Harriet Lau
- Professor Lau is a wonderful professor and human being. Seriously the nicest most passionate professor I’ve ever had.
- I personally don’t find earth science very interesting, so I was still mostly bored despite Professor Lau’s clear passion for the subject. However, if it interests you, she is definitely the perfect professor for you.
- There was an earth science field trip at the beginning of the semester, which was cool, even if I didn’t learn all that much lol
- Very easy A. The grade is solely based on a few labs (easy) and a final presentation on an earth science topic of your choice (no final exam!). It was easy, but the groups were assigned and I happened to get a shitty group, so be wary of that.
- Overall, highly recommend taking Lau’s EPS 50 if you need it to fulfill some requirement or breadth.
- Workload: Less than 1 hour a week

PB HLTH 142 (or PH 142): 8/10

- I took this with Professor Corinne Riddell, who is also a great, passionate lecturer. Again, keep the professor in mind though, as different professors run the course differently.
- Most important to me as a data science major was that this course taught me the R programming language. As someone with quite a bit of programming experience, I could’ve done with a more fast-paced curriculum, but I understand that this course is geared towards public health majors and other students that haven’t done coding before. I don’t know if I can truly say whether it’s a gentle intro to programming, but it seemed fine to me, especially since the lab sections walk you through everything.
- The grade was based on weekly labs, semi-weekly quizzes, two midterms, a final, and a semester-long project. I felt all of these were very easy and fair.
- The project in particular was shockingly easy. It’s a group project, and it took us, collectively and working together over a Zoom call, just 4 hours over the entire semester.
- The course was divided into three sections: intro to coding in R, probability and confidence interval stuff, and finally hypothesis testing. I liked this separation of material, and it was decently interesting to me as a data science major. I actually really recommend this course if you are a data science major in need of more upper division units, as it also teaches you R, which is nice to put on the resume.
- Workload: 2-3 hours a week","My turn. 

CS 170 - 6/10

* Nelson is an amazing lecturer. Probably the best I’ve ever had here. 
* Homework can be challenging but it’s fine if you have a study group and/or peruse OH. Though they take upwards of a month to grade some of them. 
* I’m not a fan of project grading being based on a leaderboard, but I do like the programming aspect. I also like the introduction of coding HW as it makes concepts feel more applicable. I hope it continues. 

Linguistics 100 - 8/10

* It feels like the course has still been optimized for a fully online format, so I’m not sure if it will be that way in the spring. 
* Just a solid class overall. Good quality lectures, reasonable assignments and exams, and discussion is extremely valuable. 
* There can be a lot of assignments to keep up with though, not least daily lecture check-ins. Also, because they’re on bCourses you may have to scroll a lot. 

And now...

Data 100 - 3/10

* Just read any Data 100 post on this sub. 
* Though I will say the content is very practical and useful. And I’ve seen worse quality lecturers. And the TAs know their stuff in section.
I'm taking IEOR 172 next semester, though it's going to be with Pirutinsky. Could you elaborate on how Math 53 didn't end up playing into the course content? I've never taken a probability/stats relevant class in my life and my Math 53/54 knowledge is pretty shaky, so I'm worried that I won't have a good base going in.
Could you send me the syllabus to 172 if you don't mind?
hey I DM'd you about 172 and 142, great post btw!
Yeah it seems Data 100 has been getting worse and worse. I took it in spring 2021 and I really didn’t get the hype.
Calculus techniques (exclusively multiple integrals) were used very sparingly in the last two or so weeks of material. Basically all you need to know is that integrals are used to find the probability of some random variable being above or below a certain point. You don’t really need to understand the actual calculus techniques, just that probability for continuous distributions is often calculated using these techniques. However, this was not the focus of the course and there was no calculus on the final exam, just on a handful of the homework problems. You’ll probably have to email Professor Pirutinsky to verify if this is also the case with his iteration of the course, but I did not feel like Math 53 was really necessary.

With regards to probability, I had some minor background in probability since it’s a topic that’s passingly mentioned in high school level stats and pre-calculus, and the barebones are gone over in data 100, which I took. However, I think 172 is a great intro to probability without any background knowledge of any kind. It just means for you the first three or so weeks will be slightly more difficult than it was for me.
Sure! Pirutinsky's syllabus from last year can be found [here](https://tbp.berkeley.edu/courses/ieor/172/).
Darn, 

I really hope it's better Spring 2022 with Hug.
Thank you!!
as someone who hasn't taken Math 53, would I be fine taking this class with just the required Math 1A and Math 1B pre requisites? it does mention on the IND ENG catalog that we should know multivariable integration (doesn't mention Math 53) so i'm currently trying to self learn that part.
thanks! how about the fall 2021 syllabus? i don't see that on that website
Honestly it’s pretty intuitive, I don’t think you’ll even need to self-learn it. You should be perfectly fine with math 1a and b
I tried finding it on bCourses, but I guess the course was unpublished so I couldn’t get it.
thats alright thanks anyway!"

Parekh for EE 126, but [https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/EE/schedule-next.html](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/EE/schedule-next.html) lists S. Parekh for EE 126
2.

2. EE142 does exist, but I don't know how often it's taught. It was definitely offered in Fall 2017. Prof. Niknejad usually teaches it so if you're interested I'd go talk to/email him. (Also the EECS website says only EE16a/b+EE105 are pre-reqs but my EE140 prof told us you don't want to take 142 w/o 140 first.)
The second of your points has happened to me before for math courses. In my case it meant they originally planned to offer it but aren't
Will do! Thanks for the clarification - I'll probably just do 140 in that case then

Rising Sophomore L&S CS+Econ Projected Schedule - Thoughts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13js55j/rising_sophomore_ls_csecon_projected_schedule/,2023-05-16 22:09:19,"I got grandfathered in because the new L&S high-demand policy doesn’t apply to my year. General thoughts on this schedule would be nice, as well as the particular question regarding whether I should take MATH 110 or MATH 104 first. MATH 110 is an easier introduction to upper division math, but as you will see my Fall semester classes are much easier than my Spring ones this upcoming year.

Also, recommendations for classes to switch around (i.e. Taking Math 185 early and a CS class later) are welcome.

I’m double majoring in economics and computer science, and trying to minor in philosophy (out of interest) and math (it helps for economics PhD programs). I intend to pursue a PhD in economics and eventually a tenured position at a research university.

Keep in mind I came in with Econ 1, Math 1A, Math 1B, Math 53, AP Computer Science, Entry Level Writing, American History, American Institutions, Reading and Composition A, Quantitative Reasoning, Foreign Language, Social and Behavioral Sciences, Philosophy and Values, and Historical Studies done. I had around 74 units already. Now I have 97.

ECON 199


Final note - some of the classes, notably ECON H195B, ECON 199, and some of the Philosophy upper division + Economics graduate courses are dependent upon Professor approval/them being offered at that time.","Not gonna read all that but Math 54 and CS70 togeether in a summer is likely pushing the limits, even given As in the prior CS courses. If you just need to acheive a sufficient grade to declare it should be doable but getting A-s or better in both is gonna be brutal barring you have a serious math background (i.e competition math in high school).  

Have you considered taking Math 54 remotely at a CC? Should be much easier this way, allowing you more time on CS70. Since its being taken at CC it wont affect your Berkeley GPA either.
As an Applied Math student, if you're going to get out of your way to take most of the Applied Math core plus an upper-div Math elective, you might as well do the triple major in Applied Math. Most people in my cohort agree that the minor is practically useless. All you would need to do here is add in MATH 128A, and potentially two more courses that can be Econ, CS, or Math oriented depending on where you want to direct the domain toward. Yeah, it's prospectively a tougher courseload, and I would gauge this prospect further down the line until you begin taking upper-div Math courses, but if you can handle all of the above, it would probably be worth your while to raise the relevance of the Math side of your goals.
I qualified for the AIME sophomore year lol. But I’ve been out of the game since. And yeah I’m looking into possibly taking 54 at a city college. I’m registered for coastline and I’m trying to see if I can get a spot.
iirc applied math requires more than the 3 additional classes, most concentrations need more no? You can only overlap so much. Also I’m not that into math. All I really need to show for econ grad school is that I can do real analysis, I’m just adding complex and abstract algebra in order to avoid getting 0 official recognition for doing math courses, and this can be done without cutting into philosophy. But I’m not willing to sacrifice the philosophy minor in order to take courses I’m not interested in.

Thanks for the advice tho! Applied math as a major makes sense for industry opportunities, but I’m pretty set on academia, and computer science is a good enough backup as is.
I see you came to the same conclusion that I did, haha
Why is the math minor worthless ? I am also wanting to get a math minor. I am CS  + Math Minor but should I go for the major ?  I have extra space from my cs degree to do a math minor so I dont know if I should do a major .
disregard my warning then, you should be fine. I still reccomend doing the CC route for your own mental sanity and quality of life.
you can also https://cvc.edu/ to find other online math 54 articulations.
Fair enough lol. I definitely agree but worst comes to worst I’ll suffer through both.
Thank you!!
I’m also already registered as an SBCC student as I’m from Santa Barbara, but their linear algebra and differential equations classes are separate unfortunately."
Why doesn't Berkeley have its own college of computing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dhuxoc/why_doesnt_berkeley_have_its_own_college_of/,2019-10-14 11:40:33,"CS is easily the largest department at Berkeley. It is easily one of our strongest departments. MIT has it. CMU has it. UW has it. We have our own buildings, Cory, Soda, parts of Etcheverry and Evans. The admissions process is unnecessarily complicated with EECS, LSCS, GPA caps and whatnot. Why can't we simplify to a single college that will cover CS, Data Science, and whatever other majors we establish in this area in the future? We will have a direct admit for anyone who wants it, and a major admission process similar to a transfer of college process much like if you are transferring from L&S to Eng etc.","Because that's where CoE and L&S get their $. Neither willing to give it up.
It is worth noting that MIT and CMU both also have more CS faculty than we do (CMU by a staggering margin). Could be a factor
 But then we'd need to change our abbreviation for College of Chem
I wish
Why does Berkeley have L&S CS? I think it's unnecessarily complicated.

Just make the only way to do anything related to CS through EECS and cut any ties to L&S. Reinstate the transfer of college process. This effectively solves your problem.

Cut data science while you're at it too, DS majors are better off as statistics majors anyways, considering that you're gonna be a trash data scientist if you don't have an undergrad statistics level of statistical preparation (Stat 134/135 at the very least). Make DS a concentration offered through Statistics, much like how Applied Math has multiple concentrations. 

The current DS major is just watered down statistics with a CS61AB as requirements; there should be a formalized concentration instead.
They have more faculty because they have more money. If CS was in its own school it would probably also have more money
Could be something like college of computing and information
If you were going to cut either EECS or CS, why wouldn't you keep CS, cut EECS and create a separate EE major?
Exactly! None of the CS kiddos care about EE, and so we currently have a few EE enthusiasts drowning in brogrammers
Yes but move CS and DS into CoE like nearly every other university does. Then you can have CS, CE, EE, and DS either as engineering disciplines or in a college of computing.
[deleted]
I’ve been saying that for years. It’s actually a shame that the university hands out degrees that say “electrical engineering” on them to kids that only took EE16A/B. Because quite frankly, you don’t know shit about EE if you haven’t taken anything beyond those two classes.
Yeah but that’s unfair to kids who didn’t know about CS at all until they got to college.
[deleted]
It's also unfair to kids who didn't do mechanical engineering until college.

> I said in my original post that they should reinstate change of college.

This would help. But I'm not sure what's wrong with the current system other than overcrowding, which reinstating change of college wouldn't fix."

What type of consulting are you registered for under the  ASUC? Startup? I feel Ike someone already does that
Hi! Unfortunately, we aren’t accepting applicants from other UCs, but feel free to forward this to any body that you think would suit this!
Hi! We mainly do start-up and non-profit consulting, I agree that many consulting clubs do deal with a lot of similar clients due to the nature of being in the bay area. But I think one of the unique qualities that our club has is that we're a good stepping stone for new students who want to be exposed to the side of consulting but not commit long and hard hours to things such as competitions or intensive activities such as heavy data-analysis in niche industries. We select pretty well rounded companies overall and have client work that shows a taste but doesn't burden a beginner with too much duties.

ChemE 2nd Semester Freshmen Schedule Problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/j2fz0z/cheme_2nd_semester_freshmen_schedule_problem/,2020-09-29 22:10:25,"I’m currently a freshmen ChemE and I’m taking Math 53, Chem 4A and Physics 7A(12 units). I know this isn’t much but I have As in all of them and I’m working 7 hour shifts on Tuesdays, Wednesday’s and Saturdays(21 hours per week total). I was originally also taking English R1A but I had to drop because it was mandatory attendance during my shifts and I figured I could take it next semester. It hasn’t been too bad so far about what I expect the worst of it is just 4A Labs, extremely difficult exams from my 7A prof(Charman) and long problem sets from 53. Next semester I’m looking at taking Chem Eng 40, Eng 7, Chem 4B, English R1A and Math 54(19 units). Is the increase from 12 to 19 units too much? Should I quit my job in order to handle this workload or is it too much even without a job? Just wondering how much harder this combination of classes will compare to what I currently have on my plate.","Hey fellow CoC student here. I think 19 units with a job may be hard to pull off but it's not impossible. In the CoC I usually think that around 15 units plus a job and life balance is the most I would do personally. But if you're willing to sacrifice one of those things you could totally do it.

Most R1A classes are a joke and you could easily get an A with a couple hours a week of time. Math 54 is pretty dependent on the person, some people get it easily and some people don't. I personally would never go to lecture or discussion and still ended with an A in the course but my friend who is smarter than me in most other classes struggled a lot. Chem 4B is much worse than 4A, at least in terms of material difficulty and lab difficulty in my opinion. Things are just more tedious and you don't have the background from AP Chem or something to rely on. Eng 7 is a good amount of work and hard if you don't have coding experience and CBE 40 is pretty easy. 

In summary, you could totally pull it off, but it would be a grind for sure. I would recommend waiting to take Math 54 until an easier semester load frees up so you'll have some time to focus on enjoying things or your personal/mental health. But that's just my opinion and I know the ChemE schedule is pretty tight and impacted. But all my friends in ChemE didn't have both 54/53 finished in their freshman years and they're graduating early so I'm sure it would be fine.

Hope that helps!"
Some questions regarding CS61A cs E7,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/py8c6i/some_questions_regarding_cs61a_cs_e7/,2021-09-29 17:23:32,"So last semester I took E7, and, from my own experience, I thought this was the worst class I’ve ever taken. I won’t get into reasons why I thought this, but the takeaway was that I retained next to no knowledge about using MATLAB and I relied heavily on the StackExchange and forums throughout the course. That was my first programming course, however. I received a P in the class as I was not confident I could get an A.

I’m returning to Berkeley next semester and I’m choosing classes. I have no prior experience with Python, but I know Python is useful on a career level for many careers including most engineering ones. So is CS61A something that’s doable AND retainable (obviously this also depends on the amount of effort, I know all that) without wanting to die given my circumstances? Or should I just retake E7, or do CS10 or Data8? My other classes would be Physics 7C, MatSci 45, probably MecEng C85 or a breadth elective. 

Thanks for responses.","If you wanted a pure intro to Python programming class, I do believe Data 94 is offered again this Spring.  Data 8 is an intro to Data Science that is more of a Stats class but you do learn Python to some degree from scratch.  CS 61A somewhat assumes you know some Python already, but by and large it is a concepts class, with some programming reinforcement.
e7 is just a terrible class in general from what i've heard so don't retake it. data 8 + cs 88 sounds like a very good two-semester combo for you
If you took E7 with Frenklach: that was a terribly designed class compared to the way CS61A is run. It's night and day. CS61A is pretty cool, the projects are fun. Not to say it's an easy class, but they provide way more resources and help if you need it.
61A is not really a python class.
Gotcha. Thanks for the response

Edit: sadly there is no data 94 this spring it seems
I appreciate your response. Thanks!
I did have Frenklach. And your description is perfect.
In which case Data 8 is more useful then?
That’s weird, it was there on Sunday. Chances are the DS department blocked this class until they find a teacher.
61a is not a class about python but you will be well versed in python by the end of it. Data 8 is really just utilizing python for statistics.
Hm. Maybe physics 77 is the way to go then?"

On Tuesday, July 7th, DHS provided an updated FAQ to the guidance. In response, campus leaders are examining our options and discussing how to respond to and comply with these new requirements.   

Meanwhile, we want you to know that we understand the concern and anxiety that this DHS guidance has caused you and we are going to make every effort to assist you as we address these new requirements. As you may know, legal challenges to the DHS guidance have already been filed in court, and the University of California has filed its own lawsuit seeking a temporary restraining order and injunctive relief to bar ICE from enforcing the DHS guidance. For now, we must proceed as though the DHS guidance will become a rule and will be in effect. 

We understand that you and your families have urgent questions and concerns about how this will impact you, your fall enrollment, and your F-1 visa status. Although we do not have all the answers yet, we want to offer you as much information as we can about the DHS guidance. Please keep in mind that this information is subject to change based on decisions made by DHS and/or the campus.


Here is what we can tell you at this time:
The July 6th F-1 guidance and July 7th F-1 FAQ from DHS address enrollment requirements of international students based on the university's instructional model for Fall 2020 semester. In the case of Berkeley, as you are aware, the university will be using a hybrid model of instruction. This means that while most course offerings will be delivered via remote instruction, there will be some courses with in-person components. 

Current J-1 guidance is far less restrictive and provides more flexibility for continuing students. Please see J-1 Students with a DS-2019.
 

New and Continuing F-1 Students Currently Outside the U.S.
Whether you are a new or continuing student, you are not compelled to be physically present in the U.S. You may remain fully enrolled through remote instruction while you are outside the U.S. We encourage students who are currently outside of the U.S. to think realistically regarding their ability to enter the U.S. for study in Fall 2020, as ongoing travel bans and consular closures may make it impossible for some students to arrive in time for in-person instruction. 

New F-1 Students: If you DO NOT intend to enter the U.S. for study in Fall 2020, you may enroll in fully remote coursework while outside of the U.S. and Berkeley International Office (BIO) will adjust your I-20 start date. If you DO intend to enter the U.S. for study for Fall 2020, you must meet specific in-person enrollment requirements, and BIO will need to make annotations to your I-20 that are required for entry. See information regarding your in-person enrollment requirement in the New and Continuing Students Inside the U.S. section below.  

Continuing F-1 Students: If you DO NOT intend to enter the U.S. for study in Fall 2020, as of today, our understanding is that continuing students outside the U.S. who will remain enrolled remotely from outside the U.S. will be kept in Active SEVIS status, thus preserving your F-1 status even while you are outside the U.S. If you DO intend to enter the U.S. for study for Fall 2020, you must meet specific in-person enrollment requirements, and BIO will need to make annotations to your I-20 that are required for entry. See information regarding your in-person enrollment requirement in the New and Continuing Students Inside the U.S. section below.   

New and Continuing F-1 Students Currently Inside the U.S.
If you plan to be present in the U.S. for Fall 2020, you must maintain full-time enrollment, including at least one in-person class. In-person enrollment should be appropriate to your academic level and program. Any remote coursework should be part of your degree requirements. If you are unable to meet these requirements, you should depart the U.S. If you are not currently enrolled in an in-person class but desire to be enrolled in an in-person class, contact your academic advisers or graduate department regarding enrollment options, and contact BIO to make sure that you understand all of your visa options before you make irrevocable plans to depart the U.S. BIO will need to make annotations to your I-20 and SEVIS record that indicate you are approved for in-person study in the U.S.

If you wish to drop an in-person class, you must be sure that you continue to comply with the in-person enrollment requirement; otherwise, you should depart the U.S. Failure to do so could mean that you will be in violation of your F-1 status and may be subject to deportation. 

What constitutes an in-person class for immigration purposes?
A course at UC Berkeley may have one or more instructional components. Each course component at UC Berkeley has been coded with a specific “instructional mode.” You may be enrolled in a course that has multiple instructional modes. You can find information regarding course enrollment and how to identify instructional modes on the Registrar’s Instruction FAQ. A course that is “in-person” for visa requirements means that it has at least one course component that has been coded with the following instructional modes:

In-person

Hybrid

Flexible

All 99, 194H, 199, 298, and 299 courses as long as they are coded as In-person, Hybrid or Flexible instructional modes

The current guidance does not place any restrictions on the minimum number of units assigned to an in-person course.

What is a fully remote course for immigration purposes? Which courses do NOT meet the visa requirements for an “in-person” course?
A course that is considered fully Remote for DHS purposes is one that does not include any in-person component. The following instructional modes are considered remote and do NOT meet requirements for an in-person course component:

Remote (Note: All DeCals have been classified with a Remote instructional mode)

Web-based

What about Filing Fee or In Absentia status for Graduate Students?
Filing Fee — Graduate students approved for Filing Fee status should provide BIO with written confirmation about the in-person requirements that have been arranged.

Registration In Absentia — During the In Absentia period, students must remain enrolled in a full-time course load. In Absentia Graduate students must have some course enrollment which includes an in-person component. In Absentia students who wish to meet the in-person standards must provide BIO with written confirmation about the in-person requirements that have been arranged. 

What if I drop in-person classes, or the instructional modes for my course changes?
 
If you wish to drop an in-person course, or if the instructional modes change for your in-person course, you must be sure that you continue to comply with the in-person enrollment requirement. If you are not able to maintain some in-person enrollment, you should depart the U.S. or transfer to another U.S. school that can meet the requirements. Failure to do so could mean that you will be in violation of your F-1 status and may be subject to deportation. If you intend to remain in the U.S., you must continue to have at least one in-person course as part of your full-time enrollment. You will not be permitted to remain in the U.S. with fully remote or online-only enrollment.

What if UC Berkeley changes to a fully remote instructional model for Fall 2020?
In the case that UC Berkeley is forced to change its instructional plan to fully remote at any time during the Fall 2020 quarter due to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or other local or state public health agencies, then students will not be eligible to remain in the U.S. on a UC Berkeley I-20. If this change occurs, DHS currently indicates the following guidance for students inside the U.S. will apply:

Students who wish to remain in the U.S. will need to take alternative steps to maintain their non-immigrant status, such as transferring to another school offering in-person/hybrid instruction.

Students who wish to depart the U.S. may be eligible to continue maintaining an active SEVIS record as they complete Fall 2020 through remote instruction. 

Embassy and Consulate Openings
Today, Monday, July 13, 2020, the Department of State tweeted the following update from @TravelGov:

""US embassies and consulates are beginning the phased resumption of routine visa services. The dates for each embassy or consulate will depend on local conditions. We are unable to provide details for each location. Please monitor the embassy or consulate website for updates.""

To find embassy or consulate websites, go to https://www.usembassy.gov/. The embassy links get you to the right embassy website, but you will have to do some clicking to find relevant COVID-19 information, as each embassy website is structured a bit differently.

Travel Bans
At this time, all travel bans announced since the start of COVID-19 remain in place. Accordingly, most international students outside the U.S. will still not be in a position to travel to the U.S. even if you are able to obtain a valid entry visa. No information is available as to when the travel bans will be lifted.

J-1 Students with a DS-2019 
New students planning to enter the U.S. for Fall 2020 enrollment: 

Guidance from the Department of State pertaining to the enrollment of J-1 students allows for sponsors to provide an instructional model that is mindful of exposure to COVID-19 while also ensuring that students enroll in some coursework that has an in-person component allowing them to have an opportunity to interact with their American counterparts. Accordingly, new students who intend to enter the U.S. and enroll in classes may do so and enroll in at least one course with an in-person component. For more information about in-person enrollment requirements, see the What constitutes an in-person class for immigration purposes? section above.

Continuing students enrolling in classes for Fall 2020:

Guidance from the Department of State pertaining to the enrollment of J-1 students allows for sponsors to provide an instructional model that is mindful of exposure to COVID-19 without laying out specific enrollment requirements. Accordingly, continuing J-1 students in active status may engage in a full course of study with fully remote courses.
 

Next Steps for All F-1 and J-1 Students:
Instructions & Survey Response: In the coming days, BIO will provide instructions that you must follow to complete a mandatory survey about your plans and intended course enrollment for Fall 2020. This information will assist us in making any necessary changes to your I-20/DS-2019 or SEVIS Record. 

I-20/DS-2019 Updates & Adjustments: After receiving responses to our survey and data from campus regarding student enrollment, BIO will begin making required updates to I-20s/DS-2019s and SEVIS records, including any necessary annotations or start date adjustments. More information about updates and document distribution will be provided soon. We will prioritize document distribution to students needing to enter the U.S. 

BIO COVID-19 FAQ Update: As soon as we can, we will update our COVID-19 FAQ to include updated questions and answers regarding the Fall 2020 instructional model and impacts to student status, travel and entry to the U.S., and F-1 OPT/CPT/ J-1 AT qualification.

Replacement I-20 Requests: Replacement I-20 requests are currently on hold until we have completed the process of updating new and continuing student records with the necessary information to meet DHS requirements. 

NIF: If you intend to enter the U.S. for Fall 2020, please continue to submit your NIF request for processing. We will be placing NIF Fall 2020 I-20s/DS-2019s on hold until we are able to confirm your enrollment and entry plans for Fall 2020.

Travel & Entry to the U.S.: We recommend that all students who intend to enter the U.S. for Fall 2020 adjust their plane tickets and arrival dates to as close to the start of the semester as possible. BIO will work as quickly as possible to update I-20s with the annotations required for entry by DHS and do our best to prioritize student entry dates. If you choose to attempt entry before receiving an updated I-20, you are entering at your own risk. Annotations are not currently required for entry for J-1 DS-2019s, but adjustments will need to be made for new students not attending Fall 2020 in-person. 

As stated earlier, we will follow up with new information and directions you will need to follow as soon as we learn more, so do look out for further communications from BIO. In conclusion, we want to reiterate our support for you and reaffirm that we look forward to welcoming you to UC Berkeley. In the meantime, we hope you stay safe and healthy.","“Continuing F-1 Students: If you DO NOT intend to enter the U.S. for study in Fall 2020, as of today, our understanding is that continuing students outside the U.S. who will remain enrolled remotely from outside the U.S. will be kept in Active SEVIS status, thus preserving your F-1 status even while you are outside the U.S.”

Does this mean that we won’t lose the ability to intern next summer? I’ve emailed BIO to confirm but the reply will be expedited here.
I'm a new international frosh and I've gotten my I-20 but I haven't been able to proceed with my visas yet. Does that make me a ""New F-1 Student"" or am I not accounted for in the email?
Do you mind posting the full guidance, if possible?
Do you think this guidance will be applied to most universities around the U.S are strictly to only some universities?
[deleted]
You're a new student.
Done
What other schools? The international office from my previous community college told me that she’s confident that big universities like Cal will/can find a way to defer your SEVIS rather than terminating it.
Cornell and UMich have both said continuing students outside the US will have their SEVIS record terminated, and they are both doing Hybrid:

Schedule Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/oqlhsc/schedule_question/,2021-07-24 00:41:41,"Hello! I am an incoming transfer student majoring in Chemistry and minoring in Data Science. My schedule for the Fall 2021 semester is Chem 104A, Data C8, Civ Eng 93, and a DeCal class. Although I’ve heard that historically, Data C8 is pretty easy, these past few semesters it’s been upped in difficulty; I wanted to ask if this schedule is manageable, or if it will be very work intensive and overwhelming. I’m not too sure about the rigor of Cal vs CC, so ideally I’d like to ease into it and get an idea of what I’ll be in for for the future. Any insight, as well as study tips for those who have taken these classes before, would be very appreciated. Thank you!",

Lol no you won’t get rescinded. I didn’t even submit the ones I took from senior year Im pretty sure 
I got a 1 on Chem, 1 on Bio, 0 on Calc BC, and I literally just drew portraits of Riemann on the BC exam. Now, I'm about to graduate from Cal. As long as you keep the required GPA by the end of your year (like a 3.0 right?), you will be completely fine.
You'll be fine, just send them in. Failing HS classes though is another story, but it looks like you got it covered.

Source: my HS friend who also went to Berkeley napped/wrote poems during the AP Calc exam
i'm not sure how much they value the AP scores you receive, I think the really important part about taking AP exams is that you get credit to place out of certain classes (like going straight to math 1b without having to take 1a first) or major prerequisites. you should be OK and i wouldn't worry too much as long as you work hard in your AP courses and end up with B+s/As as you said. if you're really concerned about it you could also drop the registration/admissions office an email or a call but i think at that point it would be more about peace of mind than anything. i really think you'll be ok as lots of people don't even take the exams for all the APs they take in senior year!
AP scores don't matter they can help get you some requirement done for your GE and such, however, don't stress over them. You don't even have to report your scores if you don't want to so if take a break and breathe, you've almost made it.
it’s on my cal central checklist tho so how do i fix that 
won't they look at the B's and A's and wonder why I slipped up so much? 
literally: communicate

If you don't take the tests: tell them and maybe explain why

If you don't pass them but still want to share the info: send the results

If you don't want to share the results: just send them a note that you do not wish to use the AB test results for course credit
Yeah I’m p sure I just never completed the checklist items..like immunizations..🤷‍♀️
probably not, as you said, you're meeting your conditions of admission."
The UC's outrageous plan to cut TAs and pay in EECS: Work-in @ Soda,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/11shm8k/the_ucs_outrageous_plan_to_cut_tas_and_pay_in/,2023-03-15 19:32:55,"**TL;DR: UC has proposed fewer TAs and massive cuts to TA pay and benefits. Come to the Work-In tomorrow starting at 10am outside Soda 380 to decisively reject this proposal and demand real staffing increases.** 

For five weeks, ASEs have been engaging in negotiations with the university to increase staffing in the EECS/DS departments. Earlier today, the university passed its first major supposal. Here's what it looks like: 

Cut TA appointments by 15%. Cut enrollment by 11%. And cut wages & benefits (including remission) by 76%. This is the university's latest proposal for the EECS/DS departments. **The number one priority of ASEs is to increase staffing in the departments, but—after more than a week of waiting—the proposal that the university passed across the bargaining table today will make nearly every problem in the department worse than it is today.** 

Here's what was in John DeNero's proposal on behalf of the university: 

* **No guaranteed increases to staffing.** 
* A **non-binding** “commitment” to adhere to the university's ""sustainable staffing model,"" which involves the following changes to enrollment/appointments: 
   * Cut enrollments by 11%
   * Cut TA headcount by 15%
      * Cut 20-hour TAs by 7%
      * Cut 8-hour TAs by 18%
   * Increase tutor/reader appointments by 39% to supplement some of the TA cuts.

In addition for these staffing figures that will **harm course quality**, the university has also proposed a compensation scheme that will be **bad for ASEs:** 

* **No tuition remission for any undergrad TA, including at 20 hours.** 
* All undergraduate salaried ASEs, including TAs, **become hourly**.
* **Immediate reduction in total 8-hour TA wages & benefits (including remission) by 53%**
   * By 2024, wages & benefits for 8-hour TAs will be **76% lower** than what is guaranteed by our union contract. 
   * The university **did not offer compensation figures for head TAs**

(You can read their full supposal [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s1vwDsFqtJyxxcys9FxjDXbvJtrNFABy/view?usp=sharing), and the entire history of bargaining at our [bargaining tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EY9Kz5y0Jh8M4cLpdZR_s-Q0aJup5EvDjW_IyxWKNno/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=116679352156687843386).)

For **5 weeks**, ASEs have been bargaining in good faith with the university to increase staffing in the departments. In our previous proposal, we agreed in principle to take lower remissions and wages than those under the union contract, saving the department over **$700,000**. However, the University’s last proposal guarantees no increases to staffing. **Our goal is to increase staffing. We are not seeking further increases to our wages in the contract.**

We can and must put pressure on the university to fully fund the EECS/DS departments. And you have the power to change it. Here's what we need every ASE and student in EECS/DS to do. 

**Work-in at the Soda 3rd floor hallway outside Soda 380**: Starting at 10 a.m., workers will occupy the 3rd floor of Soda Hall and do a ""work-in"" to show the university that we mean business and that we will not stand for this insulting and absurd supposal. Join us and work on grading, homework, projects, or anything else you were planning to work on. 

**File grievances**  To put pressure on the university to fully fund EECS/DS, ASEs across the departments are beginning to file grievances relating to overwork, misclassification, and other rampant violations. It's super easy—I just filed my first grievance yesterday. See our grievance guide [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/111jPYLO21fioYgNN4M9OLGbkw6XHzpqJ-HLzVPRj7Gw/edit) and reply to this email if you'd like someone to reach out and help you file a grievance. 

**Call and email EVCP Ben Hermalin** at 510-642-1961 and hermalin@berkeley.edu (cc: EVCP@berkeley.edu) to tell him to fully fund instruction in the EECS/DS departments. You can use a template email/script [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BoAjtyOE3XEU86-NWuWcQNXe2CTx5U-fomsBOSi3k_s/edit), but make this your own — describe the unique and troubling circumstances within the EECS/DS departments that you have personally experienced as a student/ASE. 

And **keep calling and emailing** every single day until the university funds instruction.","The UC is a joke. We went on strike last year for more pay and staffing and won, their new plan is cutting both of those.
I am very confused by this whole post.

""By 2024, wages & benefits for 8-hour TAs will be 76% lower than what is guaranteed by our union contract.""

Someone down below said the university now only wants to pay $23/hour to TAs. Maybe I'm bad at math but does that mean the contract guarantees $96/hour? My math is:

$96 - $96 hour \* 0.76 = $23/hour.

Where am I messing this up? Or does the contract actually guarantee $96/hour? I've been trying to follow this whole thing but it all feels so complicated I don't even know what's going on, even with basic stuff like this.

departments budget X dollars for Y workers at Z rate

it was naive to assume demanding an increase in Z would force an increase in X.

the other obvious answer that no one seemed to consider was maintaining X and reducing Y.

the budgets will stay the same, no extra money is coming out of thin air, and they aren't pulling it from other budget line items.

increased rates will translate to fewer workers, not increased budgets.

this is not an EECS things, its across all departments.
At this point, is it even worth going?
Outcomes such as this are exactly why I have been against the union (and therefore the strike) from the very beginning. Almost any gain that any union makes in any industry comes at the expense at both the consumers of the product (in this case, undergraduate students and prospective undergraduate students), as well as *prospective employees*, in this case, uGSIs.

I think back to when I was a lab assistant and academic intern my sophopmore and junior years, which was only about 4 years ago by now. I saw other people in my year were already becoming uGSIs which meant I knew that I could to. Why would I support a union that would effectively fight to increase barriers to entry for people in my position?
The whole department is bloated. There is no justification for having so many so many undergrad course staff. Cut enrollment, cut some undergrad TAs, hire more grad students.
The strike is to advocate for GSI not earning a living wage, not uGSI who don’t have to teach to earn their degree. To be honest, more tutors instead uGSIs to help OH is a great idea. It makes the budget works without drastically cutting class sizes. 


Look at Denero’s data sheet, under the new contract 8hr uGSI would effectively make $75/hr with tuition remission. How does that make sense when there’s a $2M budget deficit and actual GSI got less than half the raise they were striking for?
These new proposals are explicitly a result of the strike. When some positions are paid more, that takes money out of the budget and there's less money to pay for others.
With benefits and remissions as well as pay it’s about $101/hour for 8hr TAs. Take a look here if you want all the data. This edstem post contains the link to the data https://edstem.org/us/courses/23247/discussion/2773473 .
Current 20hr UGSI. This is my own understanding and opinions on the issue.

Most large CS classes are effectively completely UGSI run, even compared to large classes in other majors. When I say UGSI run, I mean the class top to bottom, including all logistics, all student activities, all course content, and more. It’s to the point where professors effectively disappear outside of lectures and maybe writing a couple exams. In all the other non-CS classes I’ve taken, professors have had a much bigger role in the class even in big classes and perform many of the roles that some TAs especially head TAs would perform in CS courses. 

Full tuition remission for 8hours was never the goal of negotiations. Rather it is the primary tool used to negotiate a commitment to maintaining staffing levels and funding. It’s true that the effective hourly rate for undergrads is high in CS, but you should also consider that CS TAs are doing many more roles than just teaching discussion and OH, which is not nearly as common in other departments.

The primary issue I personally take is that the school is cutting staffing and funding much more significantly than enrollment. And at the same time, there’s no clear direction on how classes ought to be run with this new model other than it balances the budget. Massive classes do not run themselves. You need a massive staff of TAs well versed in the subject, familiar with how the class is run, and compensated to run such classes. With many professors indifferent to running the courses they teach and eliminating most TA positions, there will likely be a significant hit in the quality of many classes.

This has been an issue in EECS for years, long before the most recent contract negotiations. In fact, the entire reason the bargaining right now over staffing in EECS is even happening is that during the strike, the university recognized that there was an issue in EECS and Data Science staffing, and agreed to bargain with the union over resolving these issues specifically. Ultimately the university for years hasn't allocated sufficient budget to staffing in EECS, and has instead relied on ASEs to overwork and on students to be okay with having insufficient support in classes. The union has even proposed compromising on some of the wages and benefits of the new contract to save the department money and encourage the university to finally fund us appropriately, but they have refused to do so. Ultimately, long as the university thinks we will accept a proposal that cuts costs for them, they will hold off on proposing anything that would actually allocate more resources to fix the problem.
That's exactly right. It's the same as research money. Increasing pay for students and postdocs is great, but funding agencies won't increase project budgets because of union negotiations. Inevitably, this means fewer hires.
UGSIs are often a better idea IMO than GSIs since UGSIs are typically much much much more acquainted with course material. 

I think replacing UGSIs with more tutors (and have tutors that are more specialized eg, Ed, OH, and Discussions) is personally the way to go. 

For the course staff I’m on, I think personally if everyone worked ~10 hours but ran efficiently and things were reorganized, the course quality would be significantly better. It would be better to the point where you could probably cut 20% of people or so.
DeNero just made new proposal today. The plan is to remove tuition remission entirely and pay TA's $23/hr (that's 5 dollars less than they make now and when you take into account fee remission about $32 per hour less). There may be a deficit but the solution is not to cut wages and staffing even further.
I kept throwing around the $50+/hr number because that was the effective pay rate the union was bargaining for... union didn't even get that much and still look what's happening 😂😂
> With many professors indifferent to running the courses they teach and eliminating most TA positions, there will likely be a significant hit in the quality of many classes.

I believe the school is better off fixing the main issue here than working to duck tape it with more uGSIs being paid FAANG internships level to do administrative work. There are professors who like to teach, and there used to be more including Weaver, Hilfinger, and Fox. Now there are fewer of them, and that impacts students and ASE experience.
As an addendum, if we switch to the new model gradually, it’ll probably be fine in the long run as newer classes of TAs, course staff, and students get accustomed to the new arrangements. However, since this is such a drastic change happening out of the blue, in the short term it will likely cause a bunch of issues on either the staff side, student side, if not both. The issues could probably be ironed out in a year or two, but no student or staff member will volunteer their entire major to decrease in quality for such a long period of time. This is especially true for students taking important classes in their major.
[removed]
Yep, tuition remission is supposed to be for grad students who usually take 2-3 courses/seminars that are approved by their advisor each semester. It was never meant for uGSIs to come in and get their full tuition waived.
That is untrue. OOS and international students are charged the same “tuition” as in state but then charged significantly higher “supplementary tuition” which is not charged to in state students. Only the normal tuition gets waived.
You're absolutely correct. I don't think our comments are really in disagreement. But yes, you're right.
Tuition remission is not wages. The proposal increases more staffing through more tutors positions. Even if the EECS has money to pay 8hr uGSI more than FAANG interns, which they don’t, there would be better place to spend that money to help student experiences. For instance GSIs and lecturers  compensation and developing more experimental courses. 

Both professors Weaver and Fox left because, #1 low compensation and #2 high student load. The faculty that actually likes to teach left because, #3 they’re forced to teach the same big courses over and over to maximize value for their labor. Weaver’ and Hug’s special topics courses has been hyped for years but never came to fruition. 

Why should a fall/spring uGSI earn 3x the money compared to a summer uGSI? Especially when summer comes around those fall/spring uGSI took off to make more money doing tech internships anyways? With the current $75/hr price tag, it makes more sense to have the tutors help with long OH queues instead of bending the budget 180 degrees or cut enrollment to meet that price.
There are some justifications behind UC's proposals:

\- UC wants to cut enrollment by 11% (although idk how I feel about this in the first place). So if the reason for advocating for an increase in TA count is to achieve better support for students, cutting enrollment is some way of achieving that.

\- UC wants to decrease TA count, but increase reader/tutor count. Like LandOnlyFish mentioned, the main issue with staffing shortage is *not* the lack of TAs, but rather the lack of support during OH, which I'm sure most students have experienced first hand. I think it makes sense that UC wants to reallocate more funding towards hiring more tutors/reades.

\- As a uGSI, it's in my best interest to continue getting full tuition remission. But to be honest I don't know if my effort justifies the original $28/hr + full tuition remission. And also agree with LandOnlyFish: our situation is different from the GSIs who are trying to earn a living wage.

If you disagree, I'm open to any critiques. Also not trying to say that we should settle with the proposal, but I think the email is painting a one-sided picture.
mit pays there undergraduate TAs 17$/hr so not sure why’s everyone complaining so much.
I agree. And this proposal does neither.
If uGSI want more staffing then why are they opposing increasing the number of tutors hired to help with long OH queues? More staff at the expense of fewer $75/hr uGSI positions. Looks like more staff is not the only or primary goal uGSI union members want here.
I’ll respectfully disagree on the second point since UGSI’s to all of the tasks listed above. Although professors have input on content, worksheets, review sessions, and exams, these are ultimately things that UGSI’s put together and sometimes with little to no input from professors who elect to delegate all responsibilities to TAs. Of course our UGSIs also perform standard tasks such as teaching discussions, office hours, and grading exams. And to your first point, yes plenty of material is reused, but also plenty of new material is added or modified, similar to what all classes do everywhere.

Our class has both GSIs and UGSIs and we all perform the same set of tasks distributed among staff members. Our UGSI’s often also take many graduate courses in the relevant area and/or do research which although is not as rigorous as that of graduate students, is still well above and beyond what is strictly necessary for teaching the class.

I do agree with you that the existing pay structure is inflated. If nothing else, you could ask GSI’s about research opportunities and letters of recommendations, whilst you can’t really do the same with undergrads. This is a natural result of their academic standings. However in terms of the tasks they perform as TAs, there is no meaningful difference. Having a pay differential between GSIs and UGSIs would be fair and acknowledge the higher amount of experience GSIs usually have in the subject. However, in my opinion the massive pay cut proposed, along with a simultaneous cut in staffing is not fair at all. Therefore, I do think it’s outrageous that BOTH pay AND staffing are being cut at the same time, especially with pay being cut so severely, and undergrads still being expected to perform the same tasks which all classes CS or otherwise requires their TAs to perform.
UGSIs also host review sessions, grad exams, have discussion sections, and available via email. UGSIs in EECS/DS deserve their compensation. 

Some of the cuts are outrageous just because a student is an undergrad doesn’t make them less qualified compared to a grad student. And the students shouldn’t be getting punished just because they have the potential of making a significant amount of money. If you are qualified you get paid.

There is a reason why there is UGSIs because there aren’t enough GSIs. I do agree that 8hr UGSI TAs shouldn’t be getting full tuition remission. However, the 20hr TAs should get remission.

Hi! I just want to respond to a few of these points, because I think you're right that these are important things to consider.

\- While I also disagree with cutting enrollment as a solution on principle, I also don't think that this would be sufficient to solve the issues in the department. For context,  after surveying ASEs in the department we estimate that around 15% of the total work done to run the EECS department comes from ASEs working above their hours, which is a systemic issue. That means that reducing enrollment by 11% would only serve to somewhat reduce the amount of overwork, and wouldn't even start to cover the issue of increasing the amount of student support, which from my experience will require substantial increases.

\- As part of this negotiations process, we have talked to many members of course staff from many courses facing the highest levels of understaffing and asked them what would fix staffing levels in their courses, and across the board the number one piece of feedback we heard was that increasing the number of 8 hour TA positions would be the most effective way to solve the staffing crisis. You're right that there are issues with OH, and we need to increase staff there, but there are also places behind the scenes where TAs are severely overworked with other kinds of work (such as administrative work or hosting discussion and lab sections) that cannot be taken up by tutors. 

\- I disagree with this framing for a couple of reasons. The first is that this is not true of all uGSIs -- for many undergrads, they are responsible for earning a living, and the salary is not a ""nice to have"" but a meaningful part of determining whether they pay rent. When the wages for undergrad TAs are insufficient for that, it discourages undergrads who have to support themselves from applying for course staff, which contributes to making course staff less diverse and representative overall. The second thing I want to point out is that every other department in every UC across the state follows the same funding model for their staff, and to my knowledge (based on talking to people who have worked with many departments) there is no other department in the state that has these issues. As uGSIs, we are doing fundamentally the same work as GSIs, and as such, we are under the same contract. In every other department in the state, the department pays all of its TAs full fee remission, and does not have such systemic issues with lack of student support and overwork as a result of understaffing. To be fair, we all recognize that the department has budget concerns, and to alleviate that, the union has proposed maintaining some level of partial fee remission for the EECS department (which again, is an unprecedented step) -- so long as in return, the university takes steps to remedy the underlying issue and allocate more funding to the department. However, we have seen with the most recent proposal, the university has been unwilling to commit to any solution that would put more resources towards staffing in the department -- which, from my experience and the experiences of many that I have talked to, would be the only type of solution that can actually address these problems.
Tutors are not able to perform nearly the same range of tasks necessary to run the class as UGSIs. To be sure, tutors are immensely helpful in the classes which currently use them; however, they are not the same as UGSIs and you cannot run classes by just eliminating your TAs who do almost all tasks necessary to running a class and replacing them all with tutors and readers who have much more focused but limited roles.

As mentioned above, full remission for 8hr UGSIs was never the end goal. Therefore, I would insist that your statement is inaccurate.

As an additional addendum, I’m not a union member. I am however heavily invested in this conversation.
[removed]
I’m not sure how it works for graduate students, but undergrads are definitely not getting there OOS and internal tuition waived. We have plenty of 8hr OOS UGSI’s in our class, and they are not getting 20k of their OOS tuition reimbursed.
To your third point that uGSI need $75/hr to pay rent, what about the rest of us? Denero mentioned the portion of uGSIs receiving any financial aid at all is close to 5%. That’s *way* less than the Berkeley student body, ~40% or something. To the point that I question if uGSI represent the student body they’re supposed to serve at all with that demographic miss match.
The proposal did not “eliminate” uGSI, merely  decreasing the amount of uGSI to what the budget allows, and use the saved money to hire 3-4 times that number of tutors. 

As a student this is a better solution that solves budget, long OH wait time without drastically cutting enrollment.
[deleted]
Can confirm
I would argue that that's part of the point. There are many factors that contribute to the demographics of course staff not matching the student body (much less the state, which is what we are supposed to represent), and one of those is compensation. How do you think those numbers would change if we were to slash benefits?
Yes, I should rephrase my statement. This proposal does not eliminate ugsi’s; however, it treats many of the responsibilities carried out by UGSI’s as interchangeable with those performed by tutors. This is not the case, one job cannot not just be simply substituted for another.
[removed]
Tuition remission for uGSI wouldn’t help students with 0 EFC who already received full financial aid anyway. It’s a drain on limited budget that could’ve been used to hire more OH support staff and tutors to improve the experience of those underprivileged students.
I understand your frustrations as a graduate student (I’m assuming). However I would like to suggest a counterpoint which is whether or not such a pay cut would be acceptable if all of our UGSIs were instead graduate students. CS hires UGSI’s to perform the tasks that GSI’s otherwise would since there are not nearly enough graduate students to staff these classes. From a class’s perspective, a UGSI costs about the same as a GSI. Therefore, even if all of our UGSI’s were instead GSI’s, we would still be having the same budget issue.

As I’m not a graduate student, I will not have the same perspective as you in terms of work done outside of teaching. Being said, my primary issue is still that the school continually shortchanges its funding for teaching. If all of our TA’s were graduate students, we would still be facing the same issues. Therefore, I would suggest that the school must also commit more funding to actual teaching, as simply papering over the issue with part time undergraduates."

Graduating Early in CoC,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nnukqv/graduating_early_in_coc/,2021-05-29 12:30:30,"Hi! Hope everyone’s summers are going well! Is there anyone here in the college of chem that is planning to graduate / has graduated early? If so, would you mind me asking what your course sequence is for upper division requirements?

I’m trying to outline a possible academic plan, but I’m wondering if the workload would be a bit overwhelming. I’m considering graduating early because it’s significantly less expensive, and I’d really like to apply for a 2 year Master’s program, so this would help shorten my duration in school.

For background: I’m a second year chemistry major and I completed 77 units (32 were transfer units from exams), including my university requirements (American Cultures, R&C, etc...). I’m finished with Math 1A/1B, Math 53, Chem 4A/4B, Chem 96, and Physics 7A.

The remaining lower division courses I have to complete are:
• Physics 7B (taking this summer, 2021)
• Chem 12A & Math 54 (taking in the fall, 2021)
• Chem 12B (taking in the spring, 2022)

Then I have to complete my upper division requirements. So I’m wondering when to take:
• Chem 104A, Chem 104B
• Chem 120A, Chem 120B
• Chem 125
• Chem 146

For 12 units of allied subjects, I’m interested in taking (but not completely decided on):
• Bio Eng 100
• Chem 121
• Pb Hlth 142

I hope I’m not missing anything. Sorry if that was a lot / annoying, and thanks so much for your time!

Also, if anyone strongly recommends against graduating early, I’d love to hear why!","The hard thing about graduating early as a chem major in the CoC is that many of the upper divs build on top of each other (i.e. I would not recommend 115 without 12B or 125 without 120A). Another issue is that many classes are Fall- or Spring-only, so it is difficult to get an even workload across all your semesters. But it is definitely doable! I would suggest you take 12B and 120A together in soph spring (+ an elective... maybe PH142?), then 120B + 104A + 121 in junior fall (121 looks to be a fall-only course). In your last semester, I would suggest 104B + 125 + 146 (146 is a spring-only course). One potential issue is 125+146--two lab classes in a semester can get pretty intense, but that is just the nature of taking 3 years to graduate.

Fitting your last chem elective, 115, would be difficult due to the sheer amount of time it requires--but its best place is probably in the summer after sophomore year (as long as it is after 12B and NOT at the same time as 125). Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions!

If you're looking to graduate in 3.5 years, then you can spread out your courseload some more and avoid issues like 125 + 146.
Thank you sososo much! This was extremely helpful. If I took Bio Eng 100 instead of Chem 115, do you think this would be a bit more manageable? I’ve been debating between the two
I didn't take BioE 100, but my friends who have say it is not a difficult class. I think you can add it to, say soph spring or junior fall, without much issue.
Ok that sounds great, thanks again!"

~~I leave it to the reader to draw their own conclusions.~~

On second thought, that may not be wise. I doubt most people will actually read the data. I'll just come out and say it: the rhetoric around crime is a bit overblown.","I put one of the FBI tables in excel and checked each [crime per 10,000](https://imgur.com/a/MjxLM8Y) students enrolled*.  That way you can compare UCs on a per capita basis.  In some cases I abbreviated the crime description.  (Ex: ""murder"" includes non-negligent manslaughter)

*EDIT: For UCs only
Despite less than some other colleges, a lot of crime is still a lot of crime.
Not gonna lie, the UCLA numbers are absolutely shocking to me. I was under the impression that Westwood was incredibly safe and much, much safer than Cal.

That said, most people didn't complain about crime until last year. Crime in Berkeley (and the whole bay area) has gotten a lot worse year since 2019. This is a national trend, though, so I'm not sure how badly the other UCs were affected.
Keep in mind that a lot of these campuses are a lot more isolated than UC Berkeley, a fairly open campus in the middle of a small city.
this is just like that ""division of diversity and inclusion is taking funding away from eecs"" circlejerk that happened on this subreddit a few months ago where a bunch of berkeley kids decided to make up a narrative with zero evidence
Yeah can you summarize...I don't have time to click on all those...

EDIT: I appreciate OP taking the time to collect all of these links! Apologies for my flippant tone, I didn't meant to sound ungrateful. When visiting this site on my phone, opening these links is very time-consuming and difficult because it doesn't open in tabs, it opens new websites or sometimes downloads something which takes a lot of time and often my phone then won't let me open it (not your fault of course, but still frustrating). A bit of extra work on OP's part will probably get their point across better and reach more people!
Santa Barbara not lookin' good with all those rapes. Yeeeeesh.
Are these crimes only listed when students were the victim, or just in the area in general? It could explain why SF appears so high if they're counting just crimes in the general area.
It seems like Berkeley is at or near the top for most crimes. LA might also have a problem though.
It's a difference in visual expectation. Westwood looks bougie af, while Berkeley looks jank af. You're trained to judge the janky place as more dangerous. But really think of it from the criminal's perspective.

For one, Los Angeles is a far bigger urban area than east bay, and therefore there is just a higher population of criminals nearby.

Secondly, if you want to rob someone, would you not target the bougie area with a bunch of affluent sheltered young adults who may have no idea how to keep themselves safe?

There's a reason USC built a whole ass wall around their campus.
based on the last 4 links, Berkeley has less crime than UCLA and is not the most dangerous UC campus
For the UC publications, click ""clery crime statistics"" located on the table of contents.  Page 73 for Berkeley and page 60 for UCLA.  The FBI one is just a table.
Damn, Auntie Barbara, what’s happening there
I strongly suspect it is only crimes against students.  Otherwise they'd have to define a perimeter in which the crimes occurred.  Also, the stats given are too low for the entire city: zero murders in LA and SF for example.
I 100% believe that and am not surprised.
Totally believe that! I just think a screenshot rather than lots of links and instructions for how to get there would be a bit more accessible.
Well, they could be using reports from UCPD, for example, who has some perimeter around the school where they report crimes. The SF numbers just seem so high (especially for property crime) compared to the other locations.
Yeah UCSF does show very high per capita property crime.  It ranks around the middle for instances of property crime but the enrollment is about a magnitude lower than many other campuses.  I'm not entirely surprised since vandals will break car windows apparently for no reason.  You can walk along the sidewalk anywhere at any time of day and see a row of cars with broken windows.  I know several people for whom it's happened multiple times.  A guy I know gets his car keyed all the time.  My friends have had their garbage cans stolen, stupid stuff like that.  Oh but one friend's residence was destroyed by arson.  Someone walked along his street one night setting house after house on fire.  He almost went to UCSF so he alone could've supplied >1% of the property crime reports.

One aspect to consider is that the same person could be the victim of property crime multiple times.  Even so, that stat is unrealistically high compared to the other campuses so there must be a nuance I'm not considering, such as what you suggested."
Which class is worse Eng R1B or Math 1B?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fvluoo/which_class_is_worse_eng_r1b_or_math_1b/,2020-04-05 14:32:54,"Hi everyone!  I'm an incoming freshman at Berkeley.  I was admitted to the Global Management Program at Haas.  I wanted to knock out a class over the summer at my CC.  I got a 5 on AP Lang/Ap Calc AB so I tested out of Eng R1A and Math 1A.  Now I have to decide which class I'm going to take over the summer and which class to take at Berkeley.   


I am definitely a stronger in English than Math, but I also want to make sure I have a strong calc background because I might want to pursue a double major in L&S CS.  Which class would be a more worthwhile class to take over the summer English R1B or Math 1B?","Quite frankly I would take both at a CC, but given your parms, definitely take Math 1B at a CC and Eng R1B at Berkeley.  At least with R1B you’ll have a few choices.  Math 1B is traditionally a very difficult class to get a good grade in.
Definitely take calculus over the summer. Math 1B at Berkeley is pretty brutal
Math 1B is unnecessarily hard at Berkeley. The general rule of thumb that a lot of my upperclassmen friends have told me is you want to knock out as many technical lower divs from ap tests or cc as possible. R1B's can be really fun if you choose a course with an interesting topic!
They are such different classes that it's very hard to compare.  But I will say there are plenty of easier RxB classes you can take than Eng R1B and Math 1B is pretty consistently brutal.  Also, RxBs are very small classes and can be focused on your interests, while Math 1B is huge and probably not super personal."
ECON major 1st year cource choices,https://i.redd.it/co3hnhiw4l3d1.jpeg,2024-05-30 08:50:04,"HELLLOO, please help me choose my cources for the first year to declare an economics major. ","The first question is - what are you bringing over from HS in terms of college credit? Any Calc? Any English?
I do A levels so i believe I am not bringing in any credits
I do Maths and Econ my bad
Will you be required to take any classes in the calc series? Math 1A/B? If not, definitely avoid them. Same with econ 1/2 if you can help it. If you've passed out of both of those I believe all you'll need to take is intro stat and one upper division econ course between Macro and Micro. I'd sign up for intro stat your first semester, and one of the upper division classes (100A/B) second semester, dependent on who is teaching. I took stat 20 my first semester, and with a HS stat background it was fine.
So when you say Math, do you mean you’re going to get college credits for the equivalent of 1 year of Calc?  ie Calc 1 and Calc 2?  You probably want to check first, you might not want to repeat stuff you’ve already gotten college credit for already. (A lot of students do repeat stuff though). 

So your Math and Econ prereqs might already be done. For Stats, usually people default to taking STAT 20, but I recommend taking Data C88S as your requirement. But in order to take that class you also need to take Data 8, either as a prerequisite or as a co-requisite.  IMO learning Python via Data 8 is somewhat more in vogue than learning R via STAT 20.

The intermediate Econ classes, you’re not eligible to take until later on.
Also, a ton of Econ students these days tend to minor or double major in Data Science, of which Data 8 is a requirement. Something to think about.
is it possible to double major in ds if accepted into l&s?
It is possible, but no one really knows the outcomes and odds of switching to/double majoring in CS/DS/Stats until next year. You apply, go thru a comprehensive review and wait and see."

Berkeley vs. Penn (both oos 😬),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wgcij6/berkeley_vs_penn_both_oos/,2022-08-04 14:16:40,"Hiiii. I’m a sophomore transfer studying CS that got into Berkeley (l&s) and Penn. You might be wondering why Im still deciding - that’s because 1) im indecisive af 💀 and 2) bc I enrolled in Berkeley’s summer start program and so am technically double committed at the moment to both Berkeley and Penn. Im taking cs61bl right now which transfers as credit at Penn. 

I was honestly originally leaning towards Penn j bc I’ve always wanted to go to an ivy and whatever but honestly I just feel so burnt out rn. Idk if I still have the wit to go to an entirely foreign school on the other side of the country. 

My pros and cons are as follows 

Berkeley pros: 
Better CS program 

Much much closer to home - I’m from the bay. When I visited campus it also felt like home. Yes campus feels a bit run down and dingy but i still felt at ease being there. 

Got a single in enclave so solid housing. 

Seems less depressed and cliquey than Penn 

Cs culture 

Cons: 
Need to declare l&s cs. 

Credit transfers poorly. I’m transferring from a non-cc college. I will have to retake cs70 and cs61a. 

Coming in as a junior. I might be kicked out after 2 years but there’s a chance I can extend my stay. 

Can only take upper division classes in my second year due to new cs enrollment policy. Essentially my first year will not involve me taking any new cs classes. 

Overcrowded and overenrolled. 

STILL PAYING OOS TUITION - I’m Canadian so no in state for me. 

Penn pros: 
General prestige / social capital(?) 

CS seems more chill there. Unlike some people at Berkeley (at least from what I’ve seen), I haven’t been coding since I was 5 years old and haven’t made apps with millions of downloads etc etc. I’ve been on the EECS discord for quite a bit and the people are really nice but it’s also painfully clear that I am a terrible cs student compared to any of them. 

Private school - smaller classes, easier time declaring cs, etc 

Can stay all 3 years or more no problem. I might graduate late a little bit just so I can study abroad.

Credits transfer generously 

It’ll be cool to go to the east coast for a couple of years and experience America wholly. I’ve been a Cali resident all my life and anticipate coming back after college

Slightly cheaper

Penn cons: 
Scared that I won’t fit in. 

Slightly worse cs program (seems like there’s better outcomes though in terms of salary [according to this government site](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/))

Far from home - I don’t know anyone going to Penn but I know a lot of people going to Berkeley. 

Stuck in the College, so I’ll have to double major in math to do CS. Realistically not a huge problem cuz I only need to take 5 more classes, of which I’m all pretty interested in but I won’t be able to do a dual degree between cs and Wharton. 

Stuck in a double but with a pretty chill guy

Please please please help me decide. Honestly at this point I just feel so lost. And also if you recognize me… you don’t 🥰.","[deleted]
If costs are the same, you should go to Penn. Networking and closeness doesn’t really matter (and Berkeley isn’t really close enough to tech companies either for it to affect your day-to-day - unlike Stanford). Most important thing for networking is working at some big tech firm, which both (with leetcode) will allow you to do.
Biased but I recommend Berkeley. Closer to a lot of the tech jobs, bigger professional network in CS.
penn
Penn
Penn. fitting in isnt an issue. school is school and generally the same vibe. You will have more overall resources at Penn + no stupid funding issues cuz Penn is rich
I went to Penn for my undergrad and am now doing my PhD at Berkeley. Given your situation and the difficulty of getting in to cs classes at Berkeley vs Penn (Penn slightly easier but has its own priority queue garbage), I would recommend going to Penn. Also you shouldn't waste time retaking classes because they don't transfer. You have a lot of networking opportunities at both places but if you ever want to venture out of SWE and going into anything else it's a lot easier to network at Penn than Berkeley. If it is cheaper to go to Penn then that is also a plus.

Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions!
It seems like you’d like to go to Penn more, but aren’t sure if it’s the best choice?

Typically I’d recommend staying closer to home - family and close friends provide an extremely beneficial support network and better access to resources needed for success.    
Since you’re not exactly new to the college game, I’m guessing you have a good idea of what you need and aren’t worried about being far from home support and resources!    
Experiencing a new locale for a couple years sounds like something you value and you may well appreciate the pace and style of a smaller, private school.     
Degree program rankings are less important at the individual student level. In a field like CS you’ll be able to get the same level of education at either school. Perhaps Penn may take more self-direction while Berkeley could prove excessively challenging. Hard to know until after haha.
     
The caveat here is that if you anticipate coming back to the Bay Area after school, you may be putting yourself at serious disadvantage career-wise. You’ll lack local professional contacts, miss potential internship-to-job opportunities, and so on.

Can you clarify why you do not qualify for in-state tuition? How do you plan to finance your education? Rough details are fine, understood if you don’t want to share this though.
What canadian uni are you from?
UPenn is better for your case
UPenn is not seen as being more chill, I can’t speak because I never went there but it’s reputation is at least just as intense as Berkeley. It’s not like Brown
Honestly culturally I’m more aligned to Berkeley than Penn. I know quite a few Berkeley people and they all seem cool. But like the biggest irk for me is that I don’t get to take “significant” classes for a year. Seems kind of a waste of time.
Even if I only get to take upper divs for one year potentially?
I KNOW the waitlist system at Penn sucks ass 😢. I see you’re doing a math PhD. Did you study math at Penn too? If so, how was that? Have you met people that double majored in math and cs there?
I feel like it might be the opposite way tbh. I want to go to Berkeley a little bit more just cuz it’s safe and familiar. However, I feel like academically I’d be shooting myself in the foot because I’d be essentially missing out on a year of compsci classes. And yeah what you say does concern me. I’m 70-80% sure I wanna end up back in the bay and obviously Penn is more east coast focused. 

I have enough money such that price isn’t really a big deal. If Berkeley was in state I think the answer would be obvious but since I’m an international student price is a non factor in my decision.
Yeah that’s a unique situation. Upper divs are where the real networking happens tbh. But I don’t have a read on whether or not networking is faster at UP vs Cal. 

I think it’s still relevant that Berkeley is adjacent to Silicon Valley. If you plan to work in tech, you’ll meet a lot of alumni in the Bay Area
Yes I actually studied both math and cs through CAS. I think a lot of people don't like the lower div classes because they're big and graded on a curve. I don't have experience taking them, but I did notice this when I TAed then. However, I think the upper div classes can be fantastic. I had some really good experiences with the upper div undergrad and PhD classes in math (and cs for that matter).
I do know other people who majored in both as well.
Interesting. It sounds like Cal is the choice for you then. Welcome home!
Oh cool! That’s exactly what I wanna do too. I’m skipping cis 121, 120, and 160 so thankfully I’m passing out of most of the lower divs as well. Regarding math and cs in cas, my plan was to do a dual degree since I heard cas second major students had lower priority in getting cis classes on that waitlist. Have you found that to be the case?

Also if you don’t mind could you share what those classes you mentioned were :o"

COL WRIT R1A opinions,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nvb6ay/col_writ_r1a_opinions/,2021-06-08 11:43:12,"Hey guys,

Im an overseas admitted student, I take ENG LIT in A Levels but that doesn't satisfy the English requirement for the College of L&S. The first AWP exam took place in May but I was taking my A Levels at the time, but it's scheduled again for ""late summer"".

I had English Language and English Literature in O Levels and have been taught in an English medium school my entire life, so my profiency in reading/analysis/writing is good and I don't really see the point in paying $110 on top of all the other costs of the university to prove said proficency. However, I have heard the COLWRIT R1A course is super heavy and not so managable with two/ three other courses. But by taking it, I would satisfy R&C A as well vs taking the test then taking both R&C A and R&C B later in the year. The ""end of summer"" date isn't here yet and I'm still taking my A Levels so that route just seems slightly uncertain to me...

I wanted thoughts from anyone who has taken COLWRIT R1A or knows about someone who has or just anyone who has any opinon on this dillema. I'd really appreciate it!","I think u can take a proficiency test when u get to Berkeley to prove ur English ability.

Shakespeare Classes for English Major,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bvbdvt/shakespeare_classes_for_english_major/,2019-05-31 11:51:27,"Can someone help me find the differences between the Shakespeare classes for the English major requirement? The course descriptions are the same for English 17, and 117(A, B, J, S) so could someone please help me make an informed decision on which to take?","hi! english major here. so for whatever reason the ONLY shakespeare class that will count for the major is 117S (I'm assuming the S is for shakespeare...?) but despite that professors who specialize in his plays will offer basically shakespeare ""electives"" and those are denoted by the other letters, like A, B, F, and T, for example. 117S is basically a survey course of ALL of his works, which is why it's the only one that counts; 17 covers the same material BUT it's a lower div and therefore will not count. i hope this helps! i took 117S in Spring 18 with jeffrey knapp, who i would definitely recommend. he's a super nice old dude who sounds like kermit the frog
That helps a lot thank you so much!
Oh, uh oh, no this is a misunderstanding: Any of the 17/117's except 117T count toward the requirement. On the ""[requirements](https://english.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/the_major)"" page for the website, you'll see 117A, 117B, 117J and 117S listed as counting towards the major.

When in doubt, check the website, or the adviser for English.
no problem! imo it's unnecessarily confusing to have all the shakespeare classes under the same number, but if it turns out you really enjoy the way shakespeare is taught at cal you'll always know where to find them!"

Why I Think Fall will be On-Line Only (Nick Weaver),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/g9vxb0/why_i_think_fall_will_be_online_only_nick_weaver/,2020-04-28 14:21:40,"I posted this to the class Piazza, but I realize there might be a wider audience for this.

tl:dr:  I’m highly doubtful we will have in-person classes in the fall, even in a “hybrid model” where large lectures are online but discussion & labs continue in person.  So I’m planning at least for on-line only for Fall 2020.

Disclaimer:  I am not an epidemiologist but a fair bit of this is remarkably close to my wheelhouse.  Internet pandemics were my first major post-grad research area and detector sensitivity is a key problem in network security.

 

This disease is nasty: I’m basing this on South Korea’s data.  South Korea managed to test & trace their way out of the epidemic, which means they caught most of the carriers, so the “total cases” as well as the “total deaths” number is probably about right  (testing is by PCR, so it only detects active infections).  https://www.statista.com/statistics/1105088/south-korea-coronavirus-mortality-rate-by-age/

Even with a fully functioning health-care system, those infected who are between 30 and 39 have a .17% chance of death. To put that in perspective, roll two dice.  If they come up snake-eyes, roll again.  If the total is 3 or less, you die lonely and alone, drowning on dry land.  And the odds get progressively worse.  40-49 is .21%.  50-59 is .77%, making a second role of 5 or less mean death.  60-69 it becomes 2.6%, so don’t bother with the second roll: snake-eyes means death.  Over 70 is a 10% fatality rate.

And there seems to be a lot of willful denial on just how deadly it is, notably from down at Stanford lead by John Ioannidis.

In particular the Stanford serology studies which try to detect infection by antibody presence (both in the Bay Area and LA) are criminally bad.

The Bay Area they released a preprint https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v1 (but the LA as far as I know is still just a press release! http://createsend.com/t/j-296D9D8CE54262BB2540EF23F30FEDED )  I don’t know why people want to think this is less serious than it is, but they do.

Let us count the ways.  The first is that their test has a “specificity” (correctly reporting a negative as a negative) of 99.5% with a confidence interval of 98.3-99.9%.  The inverse of that is the false positive rate (how we think of it from a computer security standpoint): so with 95% confidence it is between 0.1% and 1.7%.  Their raw data showed a 1.5% positive rate.

So they can’t say with confidence that they found any true positives in their raw data!

It gets worse.  How they recruited people in the Stanford study is a great way to ensure a lot of sample bias, including the wife of the lead researcher emailing others in a highly ethically questionable way and also a series of Facebook ads.  If just 1.5% of their volunteers saw the Facebook ad they used for recruitment, went “hmm, I was coughing badly last month, and wasn’t able to get tested, I want to find out for myself”, then even a test with NO false positives would account for all their data that way.

And then they compound it with math errors.  They adjust based on demographics to get their headline 2.81% figure (uh, how did this turn into 3 significant figures?).  And it is only then that they apply the false positive rate to the confidence interval!

That they haven’t slapped a “withdrawn” on the preprint, after being alerted to these numerous problems by many many people, to my mind is professional malpractice.

New York City’s serology data may be better: ~20% infected, 1% overall fatality rate, would be 8.4 million * .01 * .2 = 17,000 dead.  New York City’s reported Covid deaths are >16k, with another 4000 non-Covid reported excess deaths https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html  .  So assuming the NYC serology is accurate, this suggests a >1% fatality rate across the entire population when the health care system gets overwhelmed, so even more fatal than the South Korea numbers.

It is also remarkably hard to detect for a simple detection & response strategy:  Fever screenings, which worked against SARS, don’t work here as presymptomatic individuals are highly contagious: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5 .   This is probably the biggest difference between Covid-19 and SARS, SARS generally didn’t have presymptomatic carriers.  We have to use much more invasive and expensive testing for any detection & response strategy to work.

And finally indoor spaces are particularly dangerous.  The “Call Center X” case https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/20-1274_article can be assumed to have caught almost all those infected.  In general, you don’t have asymptomatic infection: out of 97 cases, only 4 were asymptomatic, but many were detected presymptomatic.  But the airborn spread in enclosed spaces is a nightmare.  This was a 20 story, mixed use residential/commercial building, with an open-plan call center on three floors and no company restaurant.  All but 3 infections were on the same floor: over 40% of those on that one floor were infected.  And the figure 2 is even worse: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/20-1274-f2 , showing just how dangerous this can be indoors.

On the other hand this means we are over-obsessing about hand washing and surfaces: everyone uses the lobby, elevators, doors, and the spread was restricted to the single floor.

The other telling case is “Restaurant X” from Guanghzhou China, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0764_article again with a horrifically telling figure: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0764-f1 .  Over the space of an hour and a half, along the flow of the air conditioning, at least 2 people at different tables were infected, probably by a single person who wasn’t demonstrating symptoms.

All this means is I’m not sure if even a hybrid model would work for reopening in the fall: even if our students are “just” in the 0.1% fatality range it is unacceptably bad to bury too many students, and our student population interact within the larger community.  “Restaurant X” could easily be a Dorm Dining Commons or a discussion section.  “Call Center X” certainly looks like the layout of our computer labs. 

Perhaps with aggressive test and trace and 100% mask wearing for source control we might be able to hold in-person classes, but given how dismal the US has been so far about containing this thing, with willful denial becoming a partisan issue, I really worry that we won’t have the infrastructure in place by the fall even in California.  As such I’m planning on on-line only for the fall and I think we all probably should.

-Nick","Hey Nick, thanks for making us all more informed about this.  What do you think will need to happen, from a scientific and political perspective, for testing to get ramped up to the point where we could get everything reopened by the fall?
I am honored to have been taught by such a great professor for 61C :). edit: i meant lecturer cuz weaver cares about us xD
I feel shafted as an international student. Guess I'm taking a semester off. Thanks for sharing though, this is some much needed clarity
Here's an [ars Technica article](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/04/experts-demolish-studies-suggesting-covid-19-is-no-worse-than-flu/) that also describes a lot of similar issues with the Ioannidis ""studies"", with a little more detail.

I am still completely floored by the fact that they relied on a test with a 2% false positive rate to try and show an increase of 2% positives.
You should really publish this online somewhere in a more official capacity.
I'm back home in Seoul, South Korea and I will say this: I generally have really strong feelings about digital privacy but I felt that the tracking system the health department used was really well put together and I had no complaints about giving full access to my location, etc. because I knew it was needed and it worked. If you're curious, here's a bit about my experience:

When I entered the country, I was put on a 2-week mandatory self-quarantine phase where I installed an app on my phone and they tracked me 24/7 to make sure that I wasn't leaving the house. Someone called me every day to check in on me and I got a care package with food, hand sanitizer, and masks whenever I needed them (this service might differ at a municipal level). After that, I got tested right away for free and got a negative result back.

What I think really helped was the fact that:

1. they release information about every single confirmed case–where the infected person has been, and at what time.
2. they keep an eye on all the different points of contact that may have resulted from the infected person's actions before the diagnosis.
3. They arrange for the infected person to be sent to a medical facility without contact with other people. **AND, the health department sanitizes every single place that the infected person has been, including their residence.**

I've spent quite a few years in the states now, long enough to call it home, and at times I even subconsciously pretend I'm just American. I feel disappointed and frustrated that many don't realize how they're not getting what they deserve in terms of basic healthcare. The antiquated system that is in place right now falls far behind the ""America #1"" image, to say the very least.

I know there's not much I can do about it personally, and ""technically it's none of my business"". Still, I find myself constantly thinking about potential solutions to these problems... and the sheer size of the clusterfuck just stumps me sometimes.

All I can say for now is that you need to actively protect yourself and seek the most trustworthy data you can find. The government isn't there to protect you, it seems. Best of luck to all you strong people and I know we can make it through this mess. Thanks Nick for the wonderful and informative post.

edit: grammar
Could not agree more.  I wish I knew how to overcome the human tendency to discount uncomfortable facts though.  I'm sure you're well aware that the bulk of Americans would neither listen to, nor believe what you wrote, because they don't WANT to.  I'm afraid that that fact will put a lot of pressure on the University, though certainly it's reputation and desirability will alleviate some of what would be a much greater financial toll for a different institution.
Whats your opinion on the “Covid-19 tracking app” by Apple and Google? In 161 right now and our Piazza is popping off about it, curious on your thoughts.
what about spring 21? or is that way too far in the future to tell
Nick Weaver GOAT
Great post, u/NicholasWeaver

Helps me to plan for my son’s return to Cali from NJ.
When will UC Berkeley release an official notice about whether classes will be online or in person? I’m stressed trying to figure out housing and I really want to know
Appreciate the work that went in to this, but are you sure all the numbers are correct? A 17% fatality rate for ages 30 to 39 seems too high, are you missing a decimal there?

Edit: you know what, I’m on mobile and reddit app put the decimal on the previous line, sorry!
f
What do you think about the Governor releasing the stages of social distancing, and that we may be weeks away from preparing to open school?  I saw your post on Piazza (not in the class tho), and was then saw an alert about the governor shortly after. Honestly, it doesn't seem responsible to open schools at any capacity so soon, for the safety of the parents if anything.

I'm referring to the following article:  [https://abc7news.com/health/newsom-announces-4-stages-of-reopening-businesses-/6133560/](https://abc7news.com/health/newsom-announces-4-stages-of-reopening-businesses-/6133560/)
Out of curiosity, are upperclassmen planning on returning to Berkeley next semester? I have a lease so I pretty much don't have a choice and am locked in, but I'm wondering if I should just stay home since it will probably end up being cheaper to have an empty apartment and live at home :\.
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

What if people are so done with quarantine by August they simply decide to accept coronavirus as a part of life?

Similar to how people just accept metal objects going 70 mph, despite the fact that it is insanely dangerous.
Does cs61c expand?
[deleted]
This is very insightful, thank you for sharing!
Hi Nick, what's changed since 61c lecture when you said you thought fall would be likely to be a hybrid? Is there something that happened that changed your prediction?

- current 61c kid
very insightful
What is your opinion on the probability of graduate instruction, or any other type of work grad students do, taking place in person?
When do you think lbl would reopen?
\> On the other hand this means we are over-obsessing about hand washing and surfaces: everyone uses the lobby, elevators, doors, and the spread was restricted to the single floor.

It seems plausible that we are obsessing just the right amount about surfaces and this has prevented the further spread by contact. 

This still does make a compelling case for why campus should be potentially stay closed in the fall.
Great informative post — was wondering if anyone knows/has any prediction about the possibility of time conflict enrollments being allowed if classes are moved online (personally would make it easier for me if it was allowed)
Hi Nick. Do you advise OOS and International students who pay upwards of 23k each semester to take the Fall semester off? Is it worth postponing graduation?
>Internet pandemics were my first major post-grad research area

Unrelated to the global situation, but does this include the ""Corrupted Blood"" incident from World of Warcraft?
Thank you so for much this, Nick. Your opinion is highly valued in the community, and I think this may be a wake-up call for a lot of people.

Also, what an amazing use of dice to illustrate fatality rate. It's too easy to get lost in the numbers and not realize what the true chances really are - very enlightening.
Thank you so much for posting this.
Thank you for taking the time to do this.
This was great to read - thanks Nick. What's you take on how Sweden are dealing with the virus? Did isolating the older folks early do the trick or do you think they are heading for trouble?
I've been having some aggravating discussions about death rates etc with people and hoping you can help me boil this down. Seems that some, like the Stanford guy, are arguing that there are waaay more (50-85x) more cases out there than anyone thinks while others focus on there being way more deaths (maybe 2x) than have been attributed to Covid19. 

I understand the issues with the Stanford study...in your mind are these bad enough to suggest that in fact there are not undetected cases out there (or that the number of undetected cases do not outnumber the undetected deaths)? Because it seems to me that there would have to be given the limited extent of testing, the number of symptom free carriers, etc. On the other hand, ""finding"" data that fits a pre-determined result always angers the stats gods! 

Anyway...great post and thanks. I just cant help but suspect that there is a missing piece to this puzzle that will make all the different death rates in all the different regions make sense when viewed as a whole!
Hey Nick. 

I'm from Greece and we are doing pretty well here, and there are plans to open schools again and ease the lockdown. 

If you check at some news online you can probably find more info, but my main question is, do you think that a country that is handling Covid well, should open stuff for like a month, and then maybe shut down again if data are getting scarier again? Is this the way we will be doing things for some time? 

What do you think?

25th Amendment.  Seriously, the dysfunction starts at the top, with Trump’s ego-driven whipsawing making the problem vastly worse.  We have states being dangerously inconsistent, no federal focus, and at the state level when the state does well (e.g. CA), people complain that we overreacted.

Short of a change of federal leadership, I don’t see us being meaningfully functional in the fall.
I'm also an international student and I am considering doing the same. Do you know if we will have any problems with the F-1 visa?? Can we simply extend it a semester?
do you mind explaining this concept? they misreported data ?? wild!
Yeah, /u/NicholasWeaver, post this on Medium. It'll be a much better piece than Stephen Quake's post-- [yikes](https://medium.com/@srquake/how-much-coronavirus-testing-is-enough-e66d9695a4d7).
Another factor on the university side is many will face huge pressure to reopen for revenue reasons.  Berkeley can probably keep most of the students in an online-only format, but many can’t.  So many universities will feel a huge economic pressure to reopen.
Its the right solution, but the devil will be in the details on app implementations.  EG, I would probably want the app to notify the health department, not just the user, when there is a probable encounter.

But its a long essay for another day, really.
Too far in the future.  There is a non-trivial chance that the vaccine timeline becomes a year not 1.5+ years, and I do think a vaccine is highly likely to be effective: this is the type of threat the human immune system is designed to deal with when properly primed.
No clue, they are flying blind just as the rest of us, and there are real negatives if they commit early.
(for people reading, the actual number is 0.17%, or about 1 in 590)
I fear we won’t really get out of the “first wave” with how badly things are being mismanaged.  With it being viewed as a political issue, we have states (e.g. Texas) that are, on the state level, overriding necessary public health measures like reopening movie theaters!?!? and restaurants.  I have a bad feeling that deaths per day will drop a little as New York City recovers, but from then it ends up being a continual grind of 1000+/day body bags because every time a state does a stupid thing, 2-3 weeks later there is massive suffering.
There is a huge risk difference between elementary school, high school, and university, both due to the population, how the population interacts with the outside world, and the shape of the graph.

There is a huge problem with presymptomatic carriers, but there doesn’t necessarily seem to be asymptomatic carriers: so teenagers and below are mostly (but not completely!) immune.  So it becomes a question of graph topology.

With elementary school, if you don’t have the playground common for all classes, each group of 30 kids is their own distinct graph.  High school is more mixed, and the older students may get infected at a low rate.  

College the connectivity graph is nightmare-dense, AND the student population is more likely to get sick (and therefore be infectious even if they are in the low risk of dying category).  You are also adults, so interact a lot more in the wider community.  And what about us poor faculty?
Does the sunk cost fallacy apply here? As much as I’d like to not feel like my money is wasted, I would be happier safe than sorry. Important to note that I do live in the Bay Area, so compared to most, it’s easier for me to change my mind at any time.

Also, if I lived elsewhere, I wouldn’t want to fly/drive to the apartment only to discover that I want to go back because the surge of people back on campus has lead to another local wave of infections. It may be better to wait and let time tell before making any final decisions.
This is what I'm concerned about too.
There is a reason why most models use Korea's data instead of Chinese reported data even though both are ahead of us in timeline. Korea has better testing data due to its smaller population, also better transparancy is a big reason.
Do you agree with OP’s overall point?
More data, and watching the US totally, completely, and utterly fuck this up.

There first is the gross incompetence with testing.  I would have thought by now that the US would have an order of magnitude more testing capability: you know we have enough capability when most tests are negative.  Instead, testing is STILL being used to confirm that someone who is sick is positive, not as a tool to block the presymptomatic carriers and halt the spread.

The denial of both the virulence and lethality has become a political issue, and that denial means it will spread more.  That we have idiots advocating to “Reopen California”, and the actions by other states, makes me really worry that come fall we won’t be in a good enough place for even a hybrid model.

Especially since a University like Berkeley doesn’t exist in the CA bubble, but we have students from all over.  So if we bring in a huge # of students from across the world, we are also importing those states policies for how to deal with this.
Depends.  Grad classes can probably be done on Zoom just as easily as undergrad classes, projects likewise.  

Lab work for wet labs is relatively safe in the graduate setting: only a few people, lose connectivity graph, etc, unlike undergraduate lab classes.  That is part of the problem is not just the contagion but the graph connectivity.  If you have an isolated sub graph, eg, 10 students in one bio lab, it is probably OK as the links in/out are sparse.  But with an undergraduate lab class, each lab has 30 students, and each of those students interact with a completely different set of 30 students so 1 hop out is several hundred students.
No clue, but I think LBL is actually safe to reopen with some reasonable procedures:  Everyone wear a mask except in their private offices, the on-campus dining is take-out only for either widely spaced tables outside or for eating in private offices, keep using Zoom for meetings, etc...

When I did a summer at LBL, except for the cafeteria the # of distinct people I would contact in a day is very low, and that was part of a set of generally disconnected sub graphs of people.
Really depends on the instructor, and it is as much the final as everything else.  I personally allow time conflicts and always schedule a make-up final IMMEDIATELY after the final exam slot for those who want to double-book.
If I was in your position and I could take a semester off I would: out of state tuition is horribly expensive.
Nope, but that was an amusing incident to watch.  My first major paper in security was ""How to 0wn the Internet In Your Spare Time""
Sweden has issued the same directives as other countries, except they are just recommendations and not mandatory.   Many people are following the government recommendations of social distancing, teleworking, and staying at home although some are not, but if even half the people stayed at home transmission would be reduced a lot because public areas would become less crowded. 

Unfortunately if the US downgraded our stay-at-home orders to recommendations, likely most people would ignore them and overzealous managers would make even nonessential office workers return to work without PPE or face termination.
Sweden is weird.  Their excess deaths are running ~100+/day, but its been stable for a while.  So no clue.
Oh there are clearly undetected cases out there in the Bay Area, the problem is the Stanford study is so much garbage that it can’t answer the question: what is the rate of undiagnosed/undetected infections, because that is the denominator on the infection/fatality rate.
The problem is “Snake eyes then snake eyes” is way too low (but still damn scary)...  So that is why “3”.  Proper answer would be the first die as 1 or 2, second as 1, but that is hard to explain so I use a estimate that is slightly high but still probably within the measurement error for South Korean data.
> 25th Amendment

That would require a willing collaboration of Mike Pence, majority of the Cabinet, and two-thirds of both House and Senate :(
I'm in Texas right now. We're lifting Stay in Place in a couple of days. I have already driven a few past crowded restaurant patios. 

There has to be a federal mandate or all the red states are gonna get us all killed.
i'm not really sure. i emailed the international office and i'm waiting
The Stanford serology study raises so many questions: Math errors, recruitment bias (which the authors blithely dismiss in interviews), and even ethics problems on the recruitment.

But it provides a very very comforting answer: it allows them to say “this is a bad flu, chillax”.  When it is not.

It is a really REALLY f@#$( bad flu when the health care system is not overwhelmed and, when the health cares system gets overwhelmed, 1% of everybody infected dies.

5 years from now there are going to be some very interesting psychology Ph.D. dissertations on the willful ignorance of people who wanted to downplay the problem even when it is raging through New York.
So a false positive rate of 0.1-1.7% means of the people who are NOT infected, we expect the test to wrongly say 0.1-1.7% of them are positive.

Their test said 1.5% of all people were positive. So it's not at all improbable that their entire sample had ZERO people with coronavirus given their results.
I wouldn't say they ""misreported"" data, but this is definitely case of improper interpretation of statistics.

The authors utilized a new antibody test to assay COVID-19 status in their volunteers (a huge amount of sampling bias already) instead of the traditional RT-PCR tests. The antibody tests are cheaper and faster, but there's a high false positive rate, which we know can be as high as almost 2% (i.e. if you take all of the positive hits from the test, 2% of them could be wrong). They used this test on their shitty sample and found that the proportion of people who tested positive for COVID-19 was an additive 2% more than the previous numbers reported using RT-PCR.

Subsequently, they use this to justify that COVID-19 is not very deadly because the number of cases is actually so much higher than we think it is, so we're all overreacting.

But wait! They're using a test with a 2% false-positive rate to show a 2% increase in positives. So...even if you ignore the blatant sampling issues, it would be completely reasonable to say that the only reason why they saw this increase in positives is because their tests introduced them as false positives.

Let’s hope so. I would 100% agree with you if we were sure that we find a vaccine. But we haven’t managed to do that for the more deadly SARS or MERS after decades, the coronaviruses family seems tricky.

If not, then steady spread is the only thing we could do and full lockdowns would not help us a lot.

We will also have to await the reinfection rates of people with antibodies in places like New York. Let’s hope that that number is very low.
Thank you very much and stay safe
Not to mention that people in the states where there ARE shelter in place restrictions will likely start to get lax and want to break quarantine to see one friend here, one friend there... I'm bracing for the fact that without actual on-the-ground enforcement of guidelines that a lot of people will start to slide and get selfish and/or sloppy.
I'm sorry if this was mentioned before, but can you please explain what a ""connectivity graph"" is? This post has been incredibly informative and I really want to get as much out of this discussion as I can.
Would you mind elaborating on this? I’m OOS and debating too. On one hand it is expensive, but on the other hand I won’t have to pay rent and it’s cheaper to eat with my parents at home than to cook for myself in Berkeley. Postponing a semester won’t make the overall cost go down. Thanks so much!:)
Proper classification of deaths is another potential problem.
And Iceland's data of 50% having antibodies (but seemingly a ton of them being asymptomatic as opposed to ""presymptomatic"")?

It's all very strange. 

(I'm not AT ALL advocating that we lift restrictions---clearly a better barometer of the effectiveness of ""yolo"" in the US is New York circa three weeks ago, rather than Sweden's anomaly--which is still bad, and is surprising that it's being reported as a success since they have the highest death rate in Scandinavia (at least that was true last I checked). 

It's just that there is so much conflicting evidence out there that is probably rife with errors and reporting problems simply due to the fact that we're still ""at the beginning"" of this and everyone is eager to use any contrarian story out there to peddle the narrative that we should just reopen the economy.)
It would also require the cooperation of states, including those that screwed it up in the first place.
It's so painfully obvious what will happen. Some states will lift restrictions too soon. These states will see another surge in cases  (prob not as big as first but significant). They will order another lockdown (prob less aggressive). These states will leak infections into neighboring states. Dumbass Trump will deny everything and blame in on the governors of those states. 

I don't want any of this to happen, but if you look at Nick's post (and other people who believe in stats), it's basically inevitable. Look out for your own family - stay home as much as you can.
Please keep us updated if you don’t mind. Thank you in advance
ohhh got it, that makes sense. thank you so much, really appreciate it!!
I think that is far more likely:  Researchers exist in more isolated subgraphs, which, combined with good source control, becomes far safer.  See my comments about LBL below...
This should increase funding and research interest drastically though
SARS and MERS vaccines lost funding shortly after their development started because the diseases got under control and public interest was lost in their development.  Assuming COVID 19 forces us to all stay home until a vaccine is developed, you bet there'd be tons of money flowing into it until it can be developed.
A graph is a way of representing connectivity.  Each person is a “node” in the graph, and their contacts are edges.  For a virus like this, it tends to spread through the social graph.  So if Alice and Bob are in the same class, there is an edge connecting them...  If Bob is then in a class with Carol, there is an edge between Bob and Carol, and a path from Alice, through Bob, to Carol.

Isolated sub graphs, groups of people who only interact amongst themselves, are generally fairly safe because the pathogen has to get into the sub graph first.  But when you have densely connected graphs (you are in a class with 30 other students), and the graph itself is dense (each of those students is in 3 different classes, each with 30 other students...), the number of people just 2 hops away is frighteningly large.
No, it would not. You may be thinking of a Constitutional amendment.
Yeah Texas was clocking I believe 1000 new cases a day. I am completely fine with doing online classes in fall. It’s cheaper. A Berkeley education is still a Berkeley education even if it’s online.
Anytime :)
Let’s hope so. Initial results that I’m reading about anecdotally seem promising.

So let’s hope to find something in the next year or two.
Thank you so much for the detailed response! This makes all your other comments much clearer now!
Oh, right. You're talking about the ""impeachment but worse"". Why not just impeach him again? At least there wouldn't be a need for 2/3 of the House, just a simple majority.

Without that, the President could only be removed without his consent from office for 25 days. It's intentionally made that way because otherwise there would be no reason for the impeachment process to exist.
> Oh, right. You're talking about the ""impeachment but worse"". Why not just impeach him again? At least there wouldn't be a need for 2/3 of the House, just a simple majority.

There's no effect from impeaching him again.

# The 21 Essential Things To Do

* **Go thrifting at Urban Ore** *This place has more doors than Monsters Inc. It has even more toilets than it has doors, and all of those toilets are terrible, but checking them out is always the highlight of my visit. There’s a cat that hangs out among the bins full of paintings. Beware of Urban Ore if you have a rust-related phobia.*
* **Trespass on the Pier at the Berkeley Marina** *Actually, don’t do that. While I’ve visited many times, I’ve yet to jump the fence. The pier was originally built as a ferry dock to San Francisco, and on Big Game days traffic would be backed all the way up University as a result. The pier itself is massively long (originally 3.5 miles) and stretches towards Alcatraz. It’s mostly rotting now, but I think that the city council is considering rebuilding it, so fingers crossed that we’ll be able to set foot on it someday. In terms of things that you can appreciate more legally, consider throwing a barbecue or visiting the turkeys. On the way out you’ll notice how terrible the road is. My Uber driver once told me that this is because so many people would drag race up and down that they just stopped repairing it, and now driving it is an awful experience for everyone.*
* **Eat Tacos While Watching a Rose Garden Sunset** *This one feels pretty basic, but it’s remarkable how many people I know who haven’t ever given it a visit. One of Berkeley’s best civic installations, I think. Roses bloom between March and graduation, so get out there!!!*
* **Smell at corpse flower at the** [**Botanical Gardens**](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/10/outdoors-6-hidden-gems-to-explore-at-berkeleys-uc-botanical-garden/?utm_email=34FD247564A7C51334A8C5E2AC&g2i_eui=6RGiZLQu26%2b7Ly8ImNGZHaWcBJW7A3VR&g2i_source=newsletter&utm_source=listrak&utm_medium=email&utm_term=https%3a%2f%2fwww.mercurynews.com%2f2020%2f08%2f10%2foutdoors-6-hidden-gems-to-explore-at-berkeleys-uc-botanical-garden%2f&utm_campaign=bang-mult-nl-morning-report-nl&utm_content=manual) *Depressingly few Berkeley students take advantage of the fact that admission is free for them. You probably won’t be able to see the corpse flower since it only blooms every seven years (though you can see the plant in its non-flowering state--the entire thing is just one leaf that looks like a tree), but you’ll still be able to appreciate the Chinese Medicinal Herb Garden and the extremely specific ailments that each plant soothes. Pretend to get married under the trellis in the Garden of Old Roses. Resist the temptation to steal a vegetable from the edible garden. Buy me a succulent at the garden store (or look for the pencils I designed that are carried there!) Read Paradise Lost on a bench at the top overlooking all of Berkeley. Look for salamanders in the Japanese pond. Find the petrified tree log. Appreciate how well-kept the Bamboo Path is. And if you find pineapple sage, please bring me some.*
* **Save Hundreds While Shopping for Spices in the Sari District** *I don’t think that anybody calls it the Sari District beyond me and my friends. If you’ve ever taken the 51B down University though, you’ll probably have noticed that there are like three sari stores and three Indian grocery stores all clustered together. There is no better place to buy spices in all of Berkeley. If shopping is a social experience for you, as it is for me, it can be fun spending 30 minutes appreciating the massive selection that these stores offer, and if you plan on celebrating Diwali, also pick up some rangoli powder and candles!*
* **Spend a day in Tilden** *That there are some fantastic hikes up here is a given--I’ll let you find those on your own. There are several other things to try out up here though:*

>• Walk the rim of Lake Anza  
>  
>• Hunt for mushrooms  
>  
>• Visit the Little Farm (it’s a petting zoo I think?)  
>  
>• Ride the Carousel

* **Find the Weirdest Artifact in Elmwood**  *There are some strange stores up here. Foremost is Tail of the Yak, David Sedaris’ favorite shop in Berkeley, which has several live birds in cages. There’s also a very cool Ohlone art gallery, some famous bookstores, and usually way too many kids. While you’re here, grab a chocolate sample from Casa de Chocolates and find the weirdest ice cream flavor at Humphrey Slocombe (my favorite so far is candy cap mushroom brownie). Also check out the indie comic book store and Star Grocery on Claremont Avenue.*
* **Fly a kite at Caesar Chavez Park**
* **Allow a Monitor Lizard to Inspect your Soul at the East Bay Vivarium** *And while you’re there, explore 4th street.*
* **Try a new Fruit at Berkeley Bowl** *I love their pomelos. Quinces boiled in sugar and cinnamon are also excellent, and, if you haven’t ever tried cactus fruit, consider a prickly pear. Or a buddha’s hand. Don’t get cherimoya fruit though—I accidentally dropped $11 on a single one the other week, not realizing exactly what I was getting into. I exchanged it for a bag of roasted peanuts and an $8 return. They also have an impressive selection of roots that I can’t even begin to appreciate (though I did once try their Taiwanese burdock just because it was so absurdly long), and their quick-sell rack has produce for less than $1. If it’s the right time of year you can also find Turkish delight.*
* **Contemplate the Economics of** [***BioFuel Oasis***](https://biofueloasis.com/) *One of the Bay Area’s fabled biodiesel stations, located on Ashby west of campus. My professor had a story about a guy who would drive here all the way from Menlo Park, and use up half of the gas he bought each time just driving there and back.*
* **Crash an End-of-Year Barbecue at Bowles** *I don’t think their parties are exclusive? I’ve never asked. It’s a tradition though, and they’d probably be happy to have you.*
* **Or even better: Attend Dinner at Cloyne Court. Sign Your Soul Over to the BSC. And Then Escape.** *Green Day, No Doubt, and Elliott Smith all played here, back when the punk scene in Berkeley was alive and well, and back when Cloyne wasn’t substance-free. This repurposed hotel, which I have written about many times before, was designed by John Galen Howard (the guy who designed the Campanile and many other buildings on campus--note the resemblance to North Gate Hall!) and named for Cloyne, Ireland, the town from which Bishop George Berkeley (!!!) hailed. They have a sauna and ghost stories and some of the strangest culture you’ll find anywhere in Berkeley. Read literally anything that I wrote in* [*Spring 2020*](https://elbow99.substack.com/p/now-that-we-live-in-a-co-op-we-cant) *because there’s no way I can even begin to scratch the history of the building here.*
* **Witness 4/20 on Memorial Glade** *Whatever your relationship with weed, it’s a sight to behold. I was on Bechtel Terrace, attending English 165, on 4/20/20 at 4:20. I observed that a national pandemic didn’t stop them. The year prior, Cal Day would have fallen on 4/20, but there was no way they’d let parents onto campus that day so they changed it back to 4/13.*
* **Peruse the film archive at the BAMPFA** *This is another opportunity that woefully few students take advantage of. They have both rotating and stationary exhibits, and at the start of each school year they give out free pizza and posters. Visiting the library is fun regardless of how much you know about film (for instance, who isn’t interested in at least the \*idea\* of Soviet animation), and you can also go to artsy film screenings put on by the BAMPFA student committee.*
* **Watch the moon rise over the Berkeley Hills** *Sunrises are overrated, and our view is blocked by the hills anyway. Moonrises are, in my opinion, just as beautiful, though they’re much more difficult to catch because the moon 1) goes through phrases and 2) rises an hour later each night, so it takes a lot of planning to catch it. On the right night, the tendrils of clouds in the hills will appear to catch fire, and it’s surreal to see an orb appear to melt in reverse, warped by the shape of the hills. To catch the moon rising, look up the day’s moonrise, and expect to see it rise above IHouse. When you’re further from the hills, it will appear to rise sooner (because the hills will be comparatively closer to the horizon)--at the Berkeley Marina for instance, a 7:22 moonrise might actually occur around 7:30. If you’re trying to catch it across from Kroeber, expect to have to wait 40 more minutes.*
* **Buy something you didn’t need at the Berkeley Flea Market, or any one of the farmer’s markets** *You’ve probably stumbled into one of these by accident at least once. There’s a craft fair on Telegraph most weekends in December, a permanent flea market on Ashby each Saturday, and three farmers markets scattered across Berkeley throughout the week. At the very least, try some cheese samples.*
* **Spend a memorable Halloween or Valentine’s Day participating in the Rocky Horror Picture Show at the UC Theater** *If you’re looking for a more mellow event, go to a concert at Cornerstone. I saw Summer Salt, Motel Radio, and Kid Bloom for $15 total. This is one of my favorite Berkeley venues.*
* **Befriend a cat a Sleepy Cat Books** *They only want to be your friend. The owner is also really nice. And look for the rest of Berkeley’s indie bookstores:*

>• Revolution Books *You might have seen their iconic corner signs on Telegraph. Here, the counterculture is alive and well.*  
>  
>• Moe’s  *If you’re looking for other locations featured in The Graduate, there’s also Sproul, Theta Delta Chi, and that boarding house on Dana and Channing*  
>  
>• Pegasus  
>  
>• Mrs. Dalloway’s  
>  
>• Half-Price Books  
>  
>• Eastwind Books

* **Stop into a store you’ve never visited on Shattuck or Telegraph** *At the least, every Berkeley resident should be able to say they’ve set foot inside of Amoeba or Games of Berkeley. J-town is good for snacks. If you’re closer to Northside, Victory Point Cafe is an acceptable substitution.*

# Weird Berkeley History and Rabbit Holes To Explore & Visit

Because of the nature of rabbit holes, I’m going to keep this section light so that you can discover each story for yourself.

* **What Was Formerly Barrington Hall** *Okay the stories about this place are WILD. Barrington (located near the Academy of Psychic Studies) used to be one of the houses in the Berkeley Student Cooperative. Steve Wozniak was a resident. Among other things, it was significant to the Berkeley punk rock scene, and maybe the heart of Berkeley counter culture itself. The cooperative was notorious for its non-stop partying and general lack of personal accountability (it was hard to say who was and wasn’t a resident) and eventually was shut down. There are stories of a python that escaped in the house, the “Hell Summer” that ensued when the BSC tried to crack down on the cooperative, and it birthed my favorite quote, “the poetry reading is out of control,” uttered by a police officer as Barrington residents took their last stand against eviction.* [*Here’s*](https://ejinjue.org/green-book/countercultures-last-stand/#what-were-the-problems) *where I’d begin, though as with all good research, the real facts are in the footnotes. Also be sure to read the* [*response*](https://ejinjue.org/green-book/responses/fall-of-barrington-hall/)*. It’s hard to say how things really were, since Barrington is often used as a scapegoat for counter-culture itself, but we can be certain that it was a wild ride. Some of its legacy lives on in Casa Zimbabwe (and for a while, in Cloyne, although since the university owns the building they were able to crack down on the drug culture and it’s now substance and punk rock-free) and at 924 Gilman.*
* **2603 Benvenue #4, or, more famously, the apartment from which Patty Hearst was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army** *This is a private residence, so if you visit please just glance at it before moving on. I make an annual pilgrimage here while listening to American Heiress by Jeffrey Toobin. I think a lot of my generation is unfamiliar with the story (I only came across it while listening to an interview with Terry Gross), but it was one of the most high-profile kidnappings in California history. To begin, I recommend the aforementioned book--it’s good audio for walking around Berkeley, though I think that Tobin held a certain amount of disdain for his subject--or even just Wikipedia. There’s a lot to dig into.*
* **Unabomber’s Cottage (2628-A Regent Street)** *He only taught here for two uneventful years, but somehow he’s inextricable from the Berkeley Identity. You can find your own way to this rabbit hole. While you can’t walk up to the cottage itself, you can catch a glimpse of it behind a gate. I’m unsure of whether they ever let strangers visit.*
* **Or if you’re looking for something wholesome, this Cal student’s** [**blog**](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~eldrin/index.html) **from 1999** *This is truly a gem. This student wrote about his insecurities and friendships candidly. As a student who also writes, it’s so fun and strange to see many of my own thoughts written out two decades before I ever thought them. His photos are also excellent--there are a few shots of parts of campus that don’t exist anymore. Aashna and I did some sleuthing and found his LinkedIn profile today, and it seems that he’s accomplished all of his dreams and more. In a time of uncertainty--both in my life and in my country’s history--it really meant a lot that I was able to read his story and see that things turned out alright for him.*

# Trips By Bus

* El Cerrito--Sunset View Mortuary  *Find the oldest headstone. Spend 20 minutes at the Mausoleum at the top of the hill--inside it’s spacious and light-filled--and see how much you can learn about local history just by reading the names and symbols that appear on the memorial plaques. On Sundays they give sermons, and it’s haunting to hear the words echoing through the halls. You don’t need to listen closely.*
* Oakland—Mountain View Cemetery *This was designed by Frederick Law Olmstead--the same guy responsible for Central Park and, unfortunately, the Stanford University campus. Ghirardelli was buried here! Unfortunately the Cemetery itself is closed to the public, and I have some… mixed feelings about that, but the Mausoleum is open and it’s worth the trip. It’s a Julia Morgan building (she was buried behind it, and so was Bernard Maybeck) and I can’t believe that some of the rooms are indoors--they’re filled with plants and mosaics and water installations. It’s gothic, but it’s also uniquely Californian.*
* Albany—Albany Bulb *This is one of my favorite trips I’ve ever taken--I’ve been thrice now. This former landfill was home to an art community for several decades. You can still go visit their installations if you’re willing to do a little bit of exploration. There’s a labyrinth, dragons made of driftwood, and giant sculptures made of twisted metal. It’s a quiet place. Definitely read up on its* [*history*](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/albany-bulb) *before you go.*
* Albany—TEPCO Beach *This Albany beach is littered with porcelain. It was the former dumping ground for a ceramics company. When I went I was only able to find four different colors of porcelain (the periwinkle is beautiful), not including algae-stained shards and sea glass, but maybe you can do better? The shards with the Tepco logo printed on them are highly collectible.*
* Oakland—Lake Merritt  *Surrounded by interesting things on all sides. There’s a bonsai garden, tropical garden, community garden, and creepy Children’s Playland.*
* Oakland—[Phap Duyen Tu](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phap-duyen-tu-buddha-shrine-of-oakland) *This place has one of the most interesting origins of any of the sites I’m mentioning here. Some guy was tired of neighbors dumping trash on his cul de sac, so he put out a statue of Buddha hoping it would commend some respect for his corner. While he himself was non-religious, the local Buddhist community adopted the statue and gradually began building a shrine around it. What started out as weekly offerings slowly became more elaborate, and today the shrine draws worshippers every morning.*
* Oakland—Jack London Square *I’d sometimes find myself here after shows at the Fox Theater. There are lots of great plaques to read, if you’re into that. There’s also a fantastic Thai restaurant--at the least, try one of their desserts--a replica of Jack London’s Alaskan cabin, and plenty of quiet docks to watch the water from.*

# Scenic Walks

* Codornices back trails *Find the fence covered in paintings on the northern end of the park. There’s also a beautiful glade of wild onion flowers that gets trampled every year by seniors taking photos, don’t be like them.*
* Ohlone Park & Berkeley Greenway; bike it to Solano or Richmond *You’ll pass community gardens, dog parks, and street art.*
* Albany Hill
* [Mark’s Yard Art](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mark-oliviers-yard-art)
* Blake Gardens
* Orchard Lane
* Berkeley [**Poetry**](http://berkeleyplaques.org/plaque/poetry-garden/?cat=33) **Garden** *Ginsburg was here. Kerouac too. Maybe you someday. Probably not.*
* Big C & fire trails.  *If you’re lucky, you might encounter some goats in the hills.*
* Wander the neighborhoods of North Berkeley *I usually start on Euclid to the Rose Walk (which was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps) and from there take as many staircases as possible. There’s a Monastery with a fantastic view of the Bay if you can find it, and Grizzly Peak Blvd, not to be confused with Grizzly Peak Overlook, is one of my favorite places to catch the sunset. If earthquakes and finances weren’t an issue, would you live here?*
* **Berkeley Rock Parks** *I like grabbing a chicken sandwich and potato puffs from Gregoire’s before embarking on a journey to any one of these:*

>Live Oak Park (good for lunch dates since it’s near Gourmet Ghetto)  
>  
>Indian Rock  
>  
>The vastly underrated Mortar Rock Park  
>  
>Grotto Rock  
>  
>Cragmont Rock (good for rappelling if you have the equipment)  
>  
>Remillard  
>  
>Great Stoneface Park (explore Thousand Oaks--look for the urns designating the turn-of-the-century boundaries, as well as the indentations in the rock where Ohlone people would grind acorns) & all of the natural boulders worked into the neighborhood nearby  
>  
>John Hinkel Park (sometimes an outdoor music venue; pretty, ivy-covered walkways. I’d call it romantic.)","I throw this in since I used to work there when I was an undergrad:

Check out the archives and the Bancroft Library. There's a bunch of really cool old and rare books and a lot of Cal related historical documents. You can't check anything out of the building though, you can only look at it in the reading room.
To add onto the bit about fire trails:

This section in particular (starts from the stadium, goes up to Grizzly Peak) is my absolute favorite hike in the entire area. It's a pretty steep climb but if you're a good hiker or runner then it should be very doable. 6ish miles roundtrip. When you get up into the hills you can see a huge chunk of the East Bay and into SF - and then you realize how small Berkeley is compared to the rest of the world. It's also a great place to meditate.

Walking across the Golden Gate, and looking at Berkeley/Campanile tower is an amazing perspective! Then go up the tower, and look back at the Golden Gate.
1) stay up all night watching stars at Fire Trails contemplating just how big the universe is

2) storm the field after a Big Game victory


3) eat a Top Dog after a long day of classes. As you order, think about how you’re standing right where Steve Wozniak would have ordered his first Top Dog. Don’t think too long, or the cashier/chef might yell at you 

4) Build something cool. Even if it’s stupid and you’re the only one that will ever appreciate it. It’s worth it
The pier trespassing is dangerous... Could end up with someone dying. I don't recommend.
You know, I feel like I'd appreciate this a lot more if I wasn't stuck at home for my last semester :( 

great list, though, and maybe I'll just have to come back after I graduate...
Find someone who has a code to the Essex Baths.

See a concert at the redwood grove

Meditate at the Berkeley zen center (can combine with a trip to Berkeley bowl)

Attend the Hunky Jesus and Foxy Mary Easter celebration hosted by the Nuns of perpetual indulgence.

Find the concrete slide in the Castro. Take a walking tour while you're at it.

Swim at the hearst women's gym pool at least once - it's covered in marble and old statues, and has a great view of the campus.

Catch the art students' semesterly print sale days. Extremely cheap awesome art.

Speaking of art, you can check out a priceless piece from the University - and switch it out every once in a while for something new.

Not quite Berkeley specific, but gaze at the stars while taking a late-night cliffside swim at the Esalen center.

Go go Land's End. It's beautiful.

Take advantage of the SF museums. They're fantastic. They also do free days every so often, if you don't want to pay ridiculous admission fees. Just get there early.

Children's Fairyland is not creepy! It's cute, and it's over 70 years old, which is cool. Rumor has it that it inspired Walt Disney when he was planning Disneyland.
A must do for any EECS undergraduate

Spend an all nighter in the depths of Soda Hall working on cs project due the next day
Wow I grew up in Berkeley and gotta say you've hit practically every spot I can think of! I personally also enjoy Panoramic Way as a walk up to a nice view, and would add Point Isabel to the list of places to visit if you're into dogs.

Really enjoyed reading this and extra thanks for sharing the 1999 blog
It's a very minor point, but ""find a strange fruit"" might be better worded ""find rare fruit"" or ""find unusual fruit"".
this is very helpful for people who havent visited campus yet cuz of covid, thanks!
Watch a football game from T1GHTWAD HILL!
Thanks for these excellent suggestions! I just checked out *American Heiress* on your recommendation. As an undergrad, my friend John used to live in that apartment - I think he said they still had bullet holes in the wall.
Adding on:

\- Read a book in Morrison Library

\- Visit Cheeseboard Pizza at least once (but probably 100+ times).

\- Get sushi at Kirala

\- Take BART to SF on a free weekday and explore the city, visit the de Young or Legion of Honor, get lunch, go to Blue Bottle Coffee at the Mint

\- Visit the Old Rose Garden at the Botanical Garden in May -- all the roses are in bloom and it is stunning

\- Swim at Strawberry Canyon pool in spring/summer

\- Visit a coffee shop so many times that the staff know you

\- Take grad pictures around campus; cliche, but as an alum, I LOVE having these
As a 2020 transfer, this is very sad. Hopefully I can stay in the area after graduating and doing some of these next year.
22. Not get rejected

~ An applicant preemptively crying over my rejection this thursday
Should have included attend the Big Game!
Underground steam tunnels should be there too
Mostly food related—

Get some food from the Buddhist temple in South Berkeley, Vik’s Chaat, Ethiopian food (Addis; might be in Oakland).  

Tilden—play golf/whack a bucket of balls at the driving range.  It’s a pretty course and the three-tier driving range is pretty cool.

Bike the bike trail along 580 to Richmond and check out the Rosie the Riveter installation.  If you are lucky, a park ranger will be present to answer questions.

Ride your bike around town at night.  It’s fun!

Frolf.

Do the sake tour (if it’s open).

Berkeley Bowl—best grocery store EVER.  Get the Odoriko tomatoes if they have them.

Kirala—chawan mushi is like an ocean French kiss.
This is the coolest post ever, thank you

-freshman at berkeley
For now, I've got one that you probably know too well by now:

Your home. 


Stay home, please? 
We need this thing to go away.
Hey, I love you and this post
This is so beautiful. Tysm <3
god i miss trawling through urban ore on a sunny day 

the south berkeley farmer's market is also amazing too and if u have calfresh u can get $10 worth of tokens to spend on produce!!!
While you're at the Rose Garden, go through the tunnel by the tennis courts to Cordonices Park and ride down the concrete slide on a piece of cardboard. There are usually a few pieces lying at the bottom. (Do not attempt sans cardboard.)
“Does anybody here remember Barrington Hall? Does anybody here remember Barrington?”

—Primus
You should add in some stuff in San Francisco since it's easily accessible to us. Great list for Berkeley though- both the campus and the wider city.
Have ramen at Marufuku in Japantown :D
this is late but what’s wrong with cherimoya?
This is one of the best posts I've seen on things to do, ever. Thank you stranger! Making me reminisce on so many positive memories of Berkeley + the Bay area. Truly unlimited things to do. I feel so thankful. If I do even teeny fraction of these things, I will be happy<3
Isn't Bancroft closed to people without special access? I tried going in during 2019 but they didn't let me :(

&#x200B;

Will add to check out all the Berkeley libraries, Doe itself has at least 4 smaller libraries within it.
I adore that trail, but good god that one slope midway though is terrifying
hope you'll be able to visit someday; most of these things will probably be here once you do (: and I hope your last semester goes as well as it can!
the heart women's gym/pool is a fascinating and beautiful old building!! i had no idea it existed until i took a final in there lol
the man's had a glorious career, there is no doubt! didn't know about his involvement in UC directly though (beyond the work in Claremont), most of my knowledge only goes as far back as John Galen Howard. very cool!
children's fairyland was my childhood. no disney could ever attempt the beauty of that place tbh.
not just a rumor, that's a fact! and I should have corrected that by now haha my Oakland neighbor who reads my newsletters said the same. unfortunately I can only speak from my experience walking around it when it's closed due to covid, and that's a bit eerie. always wanted to go inside, maybe someday /:
That place is terrifying and it made me scared as shit of puppets. So I have to disagree with you
Previously WEB. Previously 260 Evans.
I hate that I did this, but also glad I did for the experience lmao. CS projects and all-nighters mix well together
updated; is ""strange fruit"" used as a euphemism on the regular? I haven't ever heard it outside of the context of the song
Because of the association with the protest / anti-lynching song?
oh whoa that's wild!! cool that they preserved the history, but also kind of disturbing, but also I'd totally pay to set foot inside and see (': and I hope that you like American Heiress! Toobin is fairly well-respected, but it's clear that he's got a certain angle and sometimes the way that he editorialized to that was annoying.  Kind of reminded me of listening to Serial honestly--good storytelling and the character of the people really comes through, but you also have to wonder what they're leaving out. I'd love to read Patricia Hearst's memoir if I ever come across it!
I also recently learned that Morrison Library loans out original artworks to students! If I were a student again I would definitely take advantage of this.
Wait how do you find these?
many of these are fine to visit in a mask, I think we all agree that we need this to go away but depriving your life of all pleasure until then is not the way to go about it
it was $11 for one fruit lol
Haha yeah - I remember the first time I went there and tried to run up it. Even to this day I still remember how difficult that was!
It's a commonly understood phrase, yes. The song was capturing a phrase used at the time, and it is used sometimes now.
Because of its association with lynching, of which that song is part. The phrase exists beyond the song.

For anyone who has not heard this Billie Holiday classic.
I'll be relieved if Toobin doesn't hypnotize me into jerking off in public.

Look for the steam
oh lol I didn’t see the word “accidentally” until now
Indeed it does. Even beyond that historical meaning. The context OP provided rendered it harmless.
As an art historian I agree with your comment completely! Glad that you were not charged. Out of curiosity, what was the work?
I totally understand your position, I didn't think it was malicious by OP"

Cheap phone repairs,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cr63bp/cheap_phone_repairs/,2019-08-16 06:05:18,"Hi! I’m moving to berkeley in a few days and was wondering if there are any cheap iPhone 8+ repair places. Messed up my phone pretty badly (broken screen, glass back, camera)

It’s probably easier to j upgrade my phone but I’m waiting until September for the new iPhone. Are three way cheapish repair places in Berkeley or even the wider Bay Area? Quality of the repair isn’t too important, only has to last a few weeks :)","In Berkeley itself there are a ton of places.  They probably all charge around the same price to repair.  There’s a bunch on Shattuck and one right next to Gpysy’s restaurant on Durant, and I’ve see a couple down College Ave.  You basically can find a few places in any indoor shopping mall as well.
iResurrect on Telegraph is absolutely awesome. Cheap, quick, and the guy is really knowledgeable. It’s in a weird shopping center that’ll be torn down soon so I’m not sure what the plan is."

Hello, 

Can we please have *some* form of P/NP this semester? At least let us have one of our classes P/NP?
Can you also please make a COVID vaccine faster?
100% this. Not all of us only have schoolwork as an obligation this semester—working part-time myself on top of 3 techs—but the way the CS department’s been handling matters I get the impression that they genuinely believe their coursework matters more than my life.
It's been *super cool* seeing them say ""I'm sorry that you feel that way"", it's really not patronizing at all."

**Context:**  
This week, transit agency boards are weighing in on whether to support integrated transit fares.  [Integrated fares](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/atcYNHk4Eh2YdGnwBh-YDPBC_2qPv7WKfzKLXVjCZKzk0-OeU4pYT66WrxEcToe294raIOxPT3BPrq4Vd7-QCMQco9EQfSoJw4LLRmBf5gLCl4jZ27J71By-cYsCmNgr8aBkRH2lhk5IBnZ6jb2e2MiaYcyxc1Bcy0bG3U7QnyWpKsSAyJ-TpWg8nKQ8hmaBA9HNQZ6Jk8GpUsYckVMvWf-I4p_GG_kJQpeSG2oA59V0o4VLI_Pq4NRZ_MTyeiq6yhq6zMEue3cqbVZM4uDpGjjZtzKLi9qwGKDFd8UoUQmt4-VRGOMxjgcssqay5JFhbzhkFSaCORIpTAsw7FrWpQfb3xwNpBcGLdWZOm7uAYi1QBlFHeWEJEE0ysE9dwPP8tFoQi1PLHUrwHKYb2BdHTc1iZedsHY2Swt_zZcob1o/3g2/S8daIensQryPPYcYcWxSPA/h0/jWPg0KLHMl2zNjWH6NmPZ-QXi4bgzVY6bQdeyK7RHUY) are not only a critical part of a rider-first, seamless transit system but also a cost-effective policy that could help to bring riders back many more riders to transit.

BART’s weekday ridership has been running below 30% and AC Transit local ridership is still less than 50% of pre-Covid levels.

Making transfers free between agencies could add over 25,000 riders, a similar scale as flagship bus routes such as the AC Transit 51 lines; or both downtown Oakland stations together. And standardizing regional fares (BART, Caltrain, ferry, express bus) could help add about 69,000 riders, as many riders as another pre-Covid Caltrain.

As the pandemic eases and people adapt to new travel patterns, the regional fare [study](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/tTBUZwcBH_2q13Ow12s-jckP20jWxBj3X4ev8eQSSIy3xELxy-gwghDjaXnqwIlt1qc3-WUcQbb24tZriw_aWbyJoUJH6uXe1zg_DTjXPrYzjCxFA68r3_dgQ_4PgdWuZX-4Fv-CnxgCvpJUmCDpDOH8BsRE0mmFFIqW4x5Xa-Xr5AiHQPENnkbLTmIYNV0ncpt92PVAe6sCNVmPGFotL8Ss1VTJ0zup3Kj-uAjfGmGOTef3McbcqujAVJET3_ZbywB9I_DRIntv2b8JFwchLDeYUUroqZCfTS8QovIsKXtPZnzUpJ-RDuN7KJeDNLRO37H1NBbUETzBXDEETxDLBgtCG7tEXrh5FYO-pY3LljrheBQZVj07kMy7XtvtNZlElvV4hBeeO49UqauFVGfJKJKeLBZmpae1Os01vHgjQqPeVvgak7XLnbOf6YRAXqUnz-2HaDgBKINjVM1ZYnjTOQ/3g2/S8daIensQryPPYcYcWxSPA/h1/BtYecKJOsAwSQvloNA6OUZ_n3J6wtmqo31VeV35x8p4) shows that fare integration can be a powerful strategy to restore transit ridership by making transit more convenient, attracting new riders and new trips.

**What the hell does this mean for Cal?**   
The Campus relies on both AC Transit and BART (as well as others such as SolanoExpress, WestCAT, and MUNI) to commute to the campus. Many students and employees have asked for integrated or discount fares to get around; however, it's rather difficult since Parking & Transportation is a self-funded unit and can only provide as many programs as budgeted (P&T pays out \~$4million annually to AC Transit, the higher education discount through BART would be estimated at  $800K to $1.4 million annually)  


As the development of the campus' master plan and Long Range Development Plan takes shape, as well as a ballot measure to renew the Class Pass in 2023, the campus stands to not only lose parking spaces, [but use this as an opportunity also be partners with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission to improve the Clipper Card program](https://mtc.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=878224&GUID=69137C12-A9E3-4ACD-A51A-A9BE55274CDB&link_id=1&can_id=2a9949098c82f89a28e849287240afb5&source=email-this-coming-week-support-seamless-fares-at-sfmta-samtrans-caltrain-ac-transit-bart-2&email_referrer=email_1320093&email_subject=this-week-support-seamless-fares-at-ac-transit-and-bart) by support institutional passes such as EasyPass. It would be also important as we evolve in a post-pandemic world that  the campus, along with the region and state, get serious about environmental impacts due to increased driving and congestion. For students, this means expanded access to jobs and social events in SF, Silicon Valley, and beyond.",
Want to learn about Credit Cards?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/q8w7st/want_to_learn_about_credit_cards/,2021-10-15 13:00:04,"Have you heard about people earning and redeeming their credit card points for amazing travel experiences like free first class flights and ultra expensive 5 star resorts? Have you wondered how you could as well but you didn’t know where to start? Then this is for you!

This Monday (October 18th) from 7-8 PM I will be giving a [talk](https://berkeley-udls.github.io/) in Soda Hall in HP auditorium (306 Soda) about the fundamentals of credit cards and credit card rewards.

This talk will cover what goes into a credit score, how to build good credit and get started with getting credit cards, how to redeem credit card rewards for thousands of dollars worth of luxury travel, and how to create a strategy of what cards to get. 

A lot of people don’t realize how easy it is to get started in the game of credit card rewards and how much value they can get from it. It is quite easy to be able to earn luxury hotel stays worth thousands of dollars and first class flights worth tens of thousands of dollars. I hope to demonstrate how valuable this game can be and help people get started!

If you or anyone you know would be interested then please attend this Monday from 7-8 PM in HP auditorium in Soda Hall! There will also be a live zoom linked [here](https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/98097936555)

I missed the meeting but is there anywhere i can watch the zoom?
Wait you should never only pay the minimum.

You should pay off your card in full every month and only spend money you were planning to spend anyways.

If you pay any interest, you are losing far more money than you are gaining from the rewards.
high credit utilization is going to hurt your credit score
[deleted]
Yes! The recoding is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGNCwiZ5IKY)
With the catch that credit utilization has no memory under current scoring models, ie if you avoid maxing your credit line one or two months before applying for new credit AND you are not cycling credit (maxing your credit line and paying off the balance multiple times in a single billing cycle), you will be fine. 
But yes, always pay in full!
Yeah exactly, high utilization is only a temp problem for your score. But the interest payed will be more than the credit card rewards earned"

**Regarding Data**

When we use digital services, we also trust the company behind it with our data.  Most times, we understand that explicitly giving the company permission to use the data collected in ways that directly benefit us.  Allowing that GPS app access to your telemetry helps it navigate you to where you need to go.  Sending a picture of your face to Snapchat servers gives you neat filters to hide that face blemish.  Of course, there is a tradeoff to consider.  For the overwhelming number of digital services that collect and use personal data, the end-user has no say over how that data is used once it makes its way back to the company’s servers.  What is the tradeoff between our privacy of data, convenience and security?  What would a useful compromise be, and is it worth it?

Personally, I don’t mind if a company uses my data to provide better recommendations, to improve the layout of a site to provide an easier to use interface, to propagate more popular content to the front page, or to find out what the most popular topics are among users for the sake of pushing out more of it.  One thing many people do take issue with, however, is the selling and trading of their data.

Companies sharing data about their users to partner companies for more effective ad-targeting, for example, is one thing.  However, consider the case where a company has so much information about their users, they can effectively custom-tailor marketing campaigns selling malicious services or products (think predatory loans or addictive activities) that can be as close to guaranteed effective.

While arguably difficult to classify an entity’s use data as “good” or “bad”, misuse and weaponization of data is a real issue.  A potential compromise would be legislation akin to the data regulation laws in the European Union, where citizens have a set of “digital rights”.  For services that collect data that does not feed back into the experience of a user with that service, companies can make available a pay-for-service, data-collection-free experience as an alternative to a free and data-collecting-supported services.^[1]

There is a concern that information the government collects on its citizens is used in unethical or malicious ways.  It has become well known that Edgar J. Hoover, the first Director of the FBI, during his time at the bureau used information at his disposal for arguably immoral and unethical purposes.  Subduing civil right groups and blackmailing elected officials.  While legislation has been introduced to help combat corruption in the face of such conduct, clearly abuse of power and information still exists.^[2]

It is in this sense that a government’s effort to collect and act on citizens’ data fails us.

A potential compromise may be more insistent oversight of data-collection and security by an elected group of people.  In October, 2013, US Congressman Alan Grayson published a piece in The Guardian, sharing his experiences with the NSA evading oversight, evening going on to say he “learned far more about government spying on citizens from the media than I have from official intelligence briefings.”^[3]

It is clear that, at least with the current state of affairs, the supposed control our elected officials have over how our own data is used against us is weak at best.

You bring up a really good point. There is already existing oversight (supposedly) that is going ignored. The government agencies and large corporations that are the subject of these find ways to skirt oversight. 

The FBI and NSA's equivalent of the 5th amendment is ""we can't discuss an ongoing matter"" or ""it's POSSIBLY a security risk"" to even share information behind closed doors to elected members of congress.

When I first read this comment I for sure thought you were trolling, but you bring up a really good point.  For the right product or service, we would gladly give up a lot of what people would otherwise think is important.

Transfer to UC from Community College in 1 year?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/2fiwxm/transfer_to_uc_from_community_college_in_1_year/,2014-09-04 21:58:06,"Hey /r/Berkeley,

I'm currently in a strange situation and I'm not sure what I want to do. I'm currently a HS senior with a fairly competitive GPA and moderately high AP/SAT scores. My chances of getting into L&S, according to current alumni, are fairly good. However, I'm thinking of another option.

By the time I graduate from high school, I will have around 20 UC transferable credits from Community College (or more depending on whether or not I take classes during Spring 2015).

I also have a pretty big list of AP tests that I have passed with mostly 4s and 5s to satisfy my IGETC credits/give me community college credit in general:

* AP Lit
* AP Eng Lang
* AP Bio
* AP Phys B & C
* AP Chem
* AP Stat
* AB/BC Calc
* AP Comp Gov
* AP Comp Sci (Useless)
* AP Art History
* AP Chinese Lang

Together with my classes at BCC, I would have almost completely satisfied my IGETC (I don't think IGETC even matters for UCB).

Now, if I simply take 21-25 credits per semester, I think I can satisfy all of my requirements to transfer to a UC in a year. (Summer 2015 & Fall 2015). Thus, if I make it into UCB/LA/SD/Davis (Preferably Berkeley), I would save 1 year of my college life and a lot of money.

Is this feasible? Or am I missing/forgetting something crucial.

---

Edit: I'm not saying that I won't apply to any college this year, but that I may consider this as an option.","I know someone who went to community college for one year and transferred to Berkeley -- similar to your situation, he had roughly 20 units of AP credit, and he took 20 units per semester, reaching 60 units by the end of community college. He was a good high school student (and got into several UC's his senior year), and he got into many of those same UC's (plus Berkeley) a year later as a transfer. So it's definitely doable.

There are a few caveats to this, however.

- He plans to stay at Berkeley for three years, so he's still in college for four years. He won't graduate ""early,"" but he did save on one year of UC tuition.

- Not all community college courses will necessarily be accepted by your college or department at Berkeley. Not all Berkeley requirements will be offered at your community college. A good number of transfers take an extra semester (total of 5) at Berkeley to fulfill all their requirements.

- Community college classes can be notoriously over-enrolled. Tele-BEARS at Berkeley is already a painful shitstorm, and community college enrollment systems are even more torturous. Berkeley has a lot of federal and private funding, but since community colleges have taken the full brunt of state budget cuts, you might get stuck at community college for more semesters than you bargained for. My friend said he got lucky with his appointment times, which allowed him to take 20 units per semester.

- You need a high GPA (3.75+) at community college to have a good chance here.

I strongly suggest applying to the UC's this year, if you can. Definitely do your homework when it comes to scholarships and financial aid, so that you can have more options open this spring. Talk to the admissions or financial aid office if you have any specific concerns. Good luck!
My apartmentmate sophomore year did this. 

She was a high school classmate (same year) who did the ""Middle College"" program in high school and racked up a ton of  college credits. In my sophomore year, she ended up being my apartmentmate (entirely by coincidence!), as a junior transfer.

I don't know the details, but it definitely does seem feasible depending on how much you have left. 
IGETC does matter for Berkeley (at least it did for me when I transferred back in 2012, I used it to get into L+S)

My friend said he got lucky with his appointment times, which allowed him to take 20 units per semester.

This will probably be your biggest hurdle depending on your community college.  I know diligent students who had to put in 3 years at a community college just to get both english classes that they needed to transfer.  It wasn't that they were bad students.  They would set alarms to wake up and enroll the minute that their enrollment window opened.  But the wait lists for the core requirements were just that absurd.  They were in there right after the recession though.  I took care of both english credits in the 2007-2008 school year no problem.  It wasn't until 2008-2009 where getting into core classes was suddenly incredibly difficult.

But it has been done!  I know folks who have done it.  And hopefully your AP credits will help you avoid those competitive enrollment core classes.
Thanks for the help! I have 11 AP scores that will give me credit (more if I take additional this year) and I have 20 UC-transferable credits at Community College already, meaning if I manage to use the AP scores, I can finish community college in just one semester. I have 2 semesters (3 if I include Spring 2015) to take all of the classes I need, which is as good shot at getting what I want.

If possible, I will probably enroll in all of my classes on the first day enrollment opens (which is why I'm asking now). My current GPA at HS is already a 4.3 so I'm confident in my abilities at a community college to perform well there.

And yes, I still do plan to apply for UCs, but I'm hoping that this can be my cheaper/faster way in. I'll keep an eye out for scholarships too. 

Thanks again!"
So your AC Transit EasyPass fouled up on the second week of classes.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pgvo9o/so_your_ac_transit_easypass_fouled_up_on_the/,2021-09-02 18:58:33,"***So here's what I know so far, mods can you please pin this to the top:***

* Most AC Transit Pass numbers converted over to the following year. It's the 12 digit number on the back of the card
* Some did not, and this is not new. This is a Clipper (Regional Transit Agency/metropolitan Planning/Clipper Owner) and Cubic (Clipper Vendor) issue. Happens every year
* However, the pandemic might have caused an issue too since many cards have not be implemented in 520-ish days (AC Transit went fare free March 31 to October 19, 2020 - many students still did not come back until this past Spring or Summer).
* Transferring your EasyPass Cards to the mobile phone app has had issues with the institutional pass. The card is bricked if you do this. This problem has been around since the Summer when the apps had been released.

***So what are your options?***

* [This is an overview of the Class Pass program,](https://pt.berkeley.edu/StudentEasypass) including steps to deal with lost or replaced cards, especially those with balances.
* It's a very good idea to [register your Clipper Cards with the Clipper Card website.](https://clippercard.com)
* [Use discretion if you want to transfer your card over to the phone.](https://pt.berkeley.edu/EasyPassAug21) If you change your mind, you could go to the P&T office for a free replacement (but no telling when the free replacement turns over, likely when the institutional passes can be added with no issue).
* Make sure you tap the card on an AC Transit bus before contacting P&T. Chances are that it does work, chances are that applying the update to 630 buses is easier said than done.
* If the card charged you a fare, that means the card probably did not turn over when it was supposed to. Contact AC Transit for a refund, but after you've gotten the card reactivated or replaced.
* [Email Parking & Transportation](mailto:prktrans@berkeley.edu) or call. The office hours are 7:30-4 Weekdays (closed Labor Day). **Provide them with your Cal1Card number and the EasyPass Clipper Card number.**
* Getting the cards reactivated has been ongoing, but it may take a day to upload. Again, 630 buses with the terminals updated on wifi is easier said than done. 

***Other things to keep in mind.***

* [AC Transit is Free on Friday.](https://www.actransit.org/article/fare-free-fridays)
* Your Cal1 Card is still Valid on [Bear Transit Shuttles](https://pt.berkeley.edu/beartransit)
* [BART is 50% off through the entire month of September.](https://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2021/news20210726-1)
* I would suggest [emailing the AC Transit Board](mailto:myvoice@actransit.org) ([Individual Board Members Here](https://www.actransit.org/board-of-directors)) and the [MTC Board](https://mtc.ca.gov/about-mtc/committees/interagency-committees/clipperr-executive-board) to express your disapproval on this transition. 
* Sign up with [Seamless Bay Area](https://seamlessbayarea.org) and [East Bay Transit Riders Union](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjN6Mzk2eHyAhV1sjEKHcAtCnQQFnoECAcQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Febtru.org%2F&usg=AOvVaw2gC-u7q6A8Olg3_MWaFnKr) and volunteer to assist with better implementation of programs like these (including fare integration with the other 27 transit agencies).","Thanks for the info👍
Just a heads up for those trying to get a refund -- AC Transit's customer service told me that ""they have no information about this technical issue"" and for me to get a refund on any of my charges on their buses, I'll have to physically visit their main office at 1600 Franklin St. in Oakland. I really hope the school can process a lot of this for us...
Contacted AC transit, they said to ""take it up to UCB"" because it's ""not their fault"" the card failed to renew, so they're not responsible for giving refunds. 

Contacted prktrans afterwards, they said to ""take it up to AC transit"" because it's ""not their fault"" the card failed to renew, and they don't issue refunds in the first place. 

Love me a Kafkaesque situation at 8 AM 😪 Might just have to take the L on the $8 I spent this weekend
https://pt.berkeley.edu/EasyPassAug21
Update on this: got to talk to multiple staff at P&T today — they said that they usually don’t do refunds or reimbursements, but since this is a mistake on someone’s end (didn’t directly acknowledge if it was their fault or AC Transit’s fault), they’ll likely announce some form of “policy” that will sound something like “we’ll cover bus fares from these dates up to x dollars”. 

It’s not a hard promise but sounds like progress to me! They took down my card number and name etc. so I hope they have updates for us soon.
There will be an update sooner than later. Thanks for your patience."
Car broken into.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/22gsrf/car_broken_into/,2014-04-07 15:47:24,"So I got my car broken into and some of my stuff stolen over the weekend. I wasn't going to post but I figured it might be worth a shot to try to get some of my stuff back. Two of the things they stole would be really easy to spot. 

One was my pretty much new Penny Killer skateboard. It looks like [this](http://legitboardshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/churchill-manufacturing-penny-killer-longboard.jpg) has white atobe brand wheels and has a sticker with [this flower of life](http://i1.cpcache.com/product/792010481/flower_of_life_sticker.jpg?height=225&width=225) patter on the bottom. They aren't very common and I had to wait months for them to be back in stock. 

The other thing they stole was my Panasonic RX-5050 Boombox. It was covered in stickers, and needs tape to keep the battery compartment closed. Also the antennae broke off and still in the back of my car. the boombox looks like [this](http://d3t3tfuk4dded6.cloudfront.net/actionable/50103cef9ede34310d001614/2012625183735-1980s-panasonic-rx-5050-getto-blaster-boombox-tape-deck-stereo-equalizer_400_299.jpg) just with more stickers and the circles around the speakers are matte grey instead of shiny silver. There is a really faint S and a J on the speakers from paint that I removed from them. 

I don't really have much hope for ever getting these back, but it'd be nice if anyone would let me know if they happen to spot either of them around town.","Check the Ashby Flea Market this weekend. People fence stolen goods there all the time. If you see someone selling them, call the cops and get BPD involved. They know there are a lot of problems with some of the vendors there.
Had my car broken into and the guys only stole the change in my cup holder.
Welcome to the Bay Area.
Criminal profile: hipster.
exact same thing happened to me
[deleted]
That boombox only cost me 5 dollars but I've had it for 7 years so it's more sentimental value than anything. 

I guess they didn't think my blanket or work clothes in the trunk were cool enough to steal. 
I've gotten my bike stolen in Berkeley. Car stereo stolen in San Jose. Ipod from my glove compartment stolen in Oakland and now this. Nothing was ever in plain view really except for maybe the stereo. The bike was locked with a U and cable lock at Unit 3 and it still got stolen. Shit sucks. My car isn't even nice. 
I think he's being downvoted because the bay area has plenty of safe cities... Cities like Millbrae and Cupertino are far more safer than Berkeley and Oakland
Not nice cars are generally easier to break into. "

Unfortunately, yes.
Yep
24k bruh, mine is like 45
Are these cost the same all semester or are some fees just one-time?
it's charged per semester on CalCentral, so annual tuition would be double 24K.

Free to attend, more info inside (venue to be determined) :D",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/p5gnz/csl_starcraft_fans_come_check_out_your_schools/,2012-01-31 17:55:36,"**UPDATE: ROOM HAS BEEN DETERMINED - ROOM 3 EVANS HALL UC BERKELEY CAMPUS. STREAM WILL BE twitch.tv/cstarleague POST BELOW UPDATED TO SIGNIFY THESE CHANGES**

The Collegiate Star League (CSL) and UC Berkeley would like you to come out this weekend to learn about the CSL and eSports events in general. With that in mind we'd like to present THE BIG MATCH, a matchup between the Starcraft 2 teams of the two rival schools, Cal and Stanford, as part of the CSL’s regular season. Cal, currently 12-2 on the season and 2nd in the division, is looking to finish the last stretch of the regular season on a strong note after suffering their second defeat of the season to UC Irvine’s squad last week. Led by ace player CheckSix Suppy, and with a strong squad behind him, Cal is looking to get into prime form and solidify their place in the division as the playoffs draw near. Stanford, currently 9-5 on the season, is looking to make playoffs by placing top 30 in interdivisional play. There’s a lot at stake for their team with only a few games remaining in the season, and they will have a sense of urgency to win as a result.

The breakdown: http://img853.imageshack.us/img853/6118/bigmatchfinal.png

Motivational Commencement Speech,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kddeka/motivational_commencement_speech/,2020-12-14 19:07:09,"I got nothing but love for you fellow golden bears, and I will miss this place deeply. I know it might be hard to feel that way now, but you got this! For those in the dark rather than near the light at the end of the tunnel, I hope you grow to love this wonderful school and feel that love reciprocated before you graduate. You deserve it.

I was just informed that due to COVID-19 my department won't be having a commencement. But this speech went through multiple drafts with professors and I think it expresses a ubiquitous sense of Cal even if it is department specific. I feel really sad that I can't give this speech anymore, so thank you for reading it.

I hope ya'll enjoy!   


>I would like to share a modified piece of an essay I wrote, which asked me to answer “What do I like the most about being a Cal student?” — trust me it was a hard prompt to answer.  
>  
>The intellectual challenge and spiritual growth that has led to me loving myself more is what I appreciate most about being a Cal student. I finished one of my UC application essays, for better or worse, by writing “I deeply desire to transfer into a student body where I am closer to the average and to be surrounded by others who are manifestly even more brilliant. I am someone who, instead of feeling dismay or envy, would relish the opportunity. The University of California is known for its stressful, competitive, rigorous environment; and with a smile, I would love every second of it.” This is still as true today as it was for me three years ago.   
>  
>Berkeley beats the best of its students, grinds down the genius inherent in us all, but its graduates leave polished and refined. Like a blacksmith whose repeated blows form an alloy into something greater than the sum of its parts, Cal does the same semester after semester. In first grade, I could not read. I was illiterate and almost held back, I could not read simple words such as “the” or “group” much less “velocity”. By middle school, I was devouring books like 1984 and Catch-22.  However, I continued to struggle with being a differently abled learner, and considered myself horrible at math. To this point, I never passed pre-calculus.  
>  
>Each of us encountered barriers and obstacles getting in, and even once we were here. It took seven long years of community college before I made it into Cal: failing classes, facing eviction and no home because of raucous housemates, and going hungry or eating only rice and beans for weeks because of insufficient financial aid, were all obstacles I faced. However, I now feel materially and emotionally secure at Cal. Before UC Berkeley, I experienced the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune; the polite but feigned response that I was a physics and political science major—but at a community college. I felt the pangs of self-doubt and remorse as my high school friends got degrees, spouses, and jobs, as I struggled through second semester calculus.   
>  
>Regardless of our background, we have each faced unique struggles and been brought together by the unique opportunity to attend what Hans Bethe described as “The greatest school of theoretical physics America has ever known.” We have tunneled through seemingly impenetrable barriers, and proven our infinite potential.  
>  
>Cal has a beautiful campus, rich cultural history, and a myriad activities for every facet and face present in its student body. However, it is the sheer genius of my cohorts, the impossibly dense and long required readings, the professor designed problem sets with no solutions available online, the introduction to graduate level material by the end of each semester, the long nights in libraries, and the sum integral daily struggle, that makes me most proud to be a Golden Bear.   
>  
>When I was fretting recently, over whether I was on track to secure a successful career, two faculty laughed and told me not to worry, and I want to share their message because it applies to all of us: “You’re graduating from UC Berkeley, you’ve already made it, people will look at that and it will open doors for you all over the world.” So I say to you, graduating class of 2020: no more imposter syndrome! We have each carried out Nobel Prize winning experiments in 111B and conquered the combined works of Dr. David J. Griffiths. To each their own, we’ve found our personal Carnot Efficiency and, in doing so, pushed ourselves to do more work and go farther than we ever thought possible.   
>  
>Wherever life takes us in the coming years, we are each and all already successes. You owe it to yourselves to acknowledge that. So please, be a fully charged capacitor and continue to let the positive current flow. Celebrate today, and give yourselves, and the blue and gold clad bear next to you, a heartfelt hug and pat on the back, because you’ve made it; and forever and always: Go Bears!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

p.s. The speech actually starts out with ""I dislike it when people make graduation speeches about themselves, we are here as a group, and a cohort. You could say that at graduation, this hard barrier, our group’s velocity has finally matched our phase velocity, and at this time, it’s appropriate for some total internal reflection. Thus, I would like to share a modified piece of an essay I wrote, which asked me to answer “What do I like the most about being a Cal student?” but I took this out because that joke is so obscure for a non-physics audience I felt it detracted from the overall message. I also took out another physics centric-paragraph in the middle for similar reasons.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL&DR: ""Berkeley beats the best of its students, grinds down the genius inherent in us all, but its graduates leave polished and refined. Like a blacksmith who’s repeated blows form an alloy into something greater than the sum of its parts, Cal does the same semester after semester. ""","i love u and polisci + physics is so cool
This part had me chuckling:

> the professor designed problem sets with no solutions available online 

Feels like a pretty Cal thing.

Your story's extremely inspiring, OP, and it's revealing of the caliber of students at this school. Proud to call you a Golden Bear, and congrats on graduating!!

Thank you. Really needed this right now as I was loosing steam to carry on my studies. I’m a transfer student too. I did four years at a community college as well. Congratulations on graduating!!

    (A Poem for the 99%)
    when Hope comes back
    he will be more than a campaign slogan
    and a face on a poster faded red, white, and blue
    he will not come from a presidential palace
    bought and paid for like a Citibank stock option villa
    he will put not forget to put on his walking shoes
    and join the picket lines in New York
    the bread lines in Baltimore
    to shake the calloused hands
    of everyone walking by

    when Hope comes back
    he might be named Barack
    but he won’t be named Obama

    when Hope comes back
    he will be a Black Panther baby
    who speaks Spanglish
    and cooks Korean tacos
    and does 180 sun salutations
    to the soundtrack of Zion I
    - yes, Hope is hella Bay

    when Hope comes back
    he will be a UFW farmworker
    who loves his fields and his flag
    more than he hates his foreman
    he will be a runaway foster child
    who forgives his parents
    he will be an Iraq war veteran
    who returns to protest in Oakland again
    without tear gas canisters to his head

    when Hope comes back
    he will come back from the future
    in a DeLorean like Michael J. Fox
    and show us all the things we’d won
    like people swimming across the Rio Grande
    for fun rather than survival
    and the only student debt being to our livers
    rather than to our banks
    and then Michael J would take us
    for a ride back to the past
    and show us this is not our first occupation
    Flint, sit-down strikers in ’36
    Alcatraz, American Indian Movement in ’69
    Sproul Plaza, Free Speech Movement in ’64
    and every semester since then that was worth a damn
    and reminded Berkeley what it means
    to be called Berkeley

    when Hope comes back
    he will be one of my students
    East Asia meets East Oakland
    brilliantly cross-continental
    even though he hates the ocean
    speaks with the wisdom of Buddha and Mac Dre
    really, he is my teacher
    and I think he knows it
    and we’re both ok with that

    when Hope comes back
    he will actually be a she
    because hey, that’s who actually gets shit done
    she will be a librarian by day, a DJ by night,
    an Occupy activist in between
    she will be thick hair and thick hips
    and if you try to touch either one
    you’ll get a thick hand to the face
    when Hope comes back
    she’ll show us to burn down the banks in our
    hearts and love without lust or profit or restraining orders

    when Hope comes back
    she will be an OPD cop,
    then NYPD, then UCPD,
    refusing to follow orders
    putting down their riot gear
    and picking up a picket sign
    cuz when the cops join the 99% they actually belong to
    that’s when the banks will have nowhere to hide

    when Hope comes back
    she will be a midwife
    in tune with the moon and the womb
    an ancient healer who knows every herb in the redwoods
    ready to help us birth a new world
    one without bombs or borders or Michelle Bachman
    a planet of peoples free to honor the earth
    and each other like the God
    in whose image we’re still trying to evolve into

    when Hope comes back
    she will be here
    right here, right now
    on the streets and plazas and parks
    of New York and DC
    Milwaukee and Austin
    Portland and Nashville
    London and Manila and Cairo
    San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley, CA
    with the people and the hashtags
    setting up her tent in the morning
    paintings banners in the afternoon
    attending ridicously long meetings in the evening
    shutting down the port of Oakland
    and reminding us all that yes,
    Hope still lives here in America
    she has always lived here with us

    and now she is back before our eyes
    marching head high, fist higher
    and whispering to the millions amongst her,
    Thank you.
    Thank you.
    Thank you.
    Thank you.
    Thank you.

And I felt compelled to write this post, provide additional context, and be a resource for anybody and everybody who wants to learn more about recruiting, hunting for jobs + internships, and breaking into ""prestigious"" roles in consulting, investment banking, product management, and more.

I personally have met some of the most spectacular, genuine, amazing, inspiring, empowering, gentle, and loving people in my life here at Cal. And yes, some of them were in what I would call the umbrella term of the wider 'consulting community' (re: consulting clubs, business frats, etc.).

And just to get this out of the way: yes, I was a part of this community. I can't speak for coding clubs, design org's, or other student groups in those kinds of spaces, but I am quite intimate with the Cal business scene. And after spending these past 4 years working my ass off in this space, I can safely assure you this: we ain't SHIT.

I could aim for the low hanging fruit (re: sexual assault, racism, ridiculous and illogical recruiting practices, toxic membership practices, a complete and utter disregard for diversity and inclusion), but honestly this post isn't about them. It's about YOU, and what YOU are capable of.

The community's marketing strategy is built on the fundamentally incorrect notion that you need them in order to earn internships and full-time jobs at the hottest spots in Wall Street and Silicon Valley. One afternoon scouring LinkedIn's may convince you this is true. And if it isn't the LinkedIn stalking that does it for you, it's the endless tabling and flyering on Sproul, the deluge of information sessions, and wave-after-wave of obnoxiously branded Patagonia-wearing 20 year old's reminding you that they're interning with Morgan Stanley next summer.

In Statistics, one of the most simple but lasting concepts you'll learn about is 'Convenience Sampling'. Our perception of reality is essentially distorted by data that is easy to draw upon, but ultimately misleading. For instance, would you believe the results of a presidential election poll conducted solely on UC Berkeley students?

Hopefully you wouldn't, because our (relatively) small campus sample size is by no means indicative of our actual voting population. Likewise, our consulting club bubble is a poor representation of what the actual professional world is like.

When I interned in New York, my club had little to no network for me to reach out to. So I learned how to build my own network for myself.

That summer, I had ***over*** ***100*** coffee chats with Cal alum working everywhere from Goldman Sachs to Google, from Wall Street to up-and-coming startups and everything in-between. What surprised me was witnessing how warm, helpful, and inspiring our alumni could be.

And what may surprise you even more is how very few of these alumni actually belonged to the wider consulting club community. Of the 25 alumni I got really close with, only one came from a consulting club. And she left after spending ***only two*** semesters in it.

These people made it to the hottest, hypest positions available to undergrads. They were consultants at BCG and Deloitte. They were bankers at Goldman and J.P. Morgan. They were PM's at Venmo and Twitter. Some of them even founded their own startups. And regardless of industry and role, of major or club affiliation (or, more commonly than not, lack thereof) they were 100% killing the game.

It opened my eyes to how insane of a bubble we Cal students live in here at Berkeley. Because once you get out into the real world, you will begin to see how much potential you truly have.

Because every single year, hundreds of students - some in these clubs, and most of them not - land amazing opportunities by virtue of their OWN hard work, grit, dedication, passion, and will.

My own personal experiences - and talking with my friends, mentors, and wider network - helped me challenge my past, misguided biases and convinced me of two simple, pervasive truths.

You don't need consulting clubs. They need YOU.

Who else will wake up at the ass crack of dawn to set up shop at Sproul, pitching tents and mentally bracing oneself for a week's worth of tabling and flyering? Who else will drink the kool-aid and indoctrinate the next generation of naive freshmen and sophomores? How else will current members direct their repressed stress when welcoming new recruits (re: you) to a series of family-friendly, ASUC-approved wholesome ice breaker activities (re: hazing)? Who else will uphold the legacy of prestige, most of which is flimsily held together by a pathology of poorly-disguised inferiority complexes?

So go out there and get that bread. Join clubs because **you** want to join them, because its members excite you and inspire you, and not because they claim to have a fast-track pass to the Goldman Sachs (hint: they don't). Make friends in the unlikeliest of places. Don't be afraid to shoot your shot DM'ing cool people on LinkedIn. You never know what you'll find.

In fact, I wouldn't be where I am today with having taken those risks. And neither will you.

&#x200B;

**tl;dr** Membership in these clubs is neither validation of your personal/professional worth nor affirmation of your success in the real world. Only *you* have the power to determine that.

How'd you talk to 100 people over the summer? How do you even start a conversation like that? What did you talk to them about? 

Asking as someone who's never really figured out what ""networking"" entails.
Some of these orgs will do you absolute wonders—so far as they have a healthy social scene, valuable resources, and meaningful projects that teach you something new. That being said, OP is right that our mindset around applying should be much different (if you’re thinking of applying at least)
Consulting clubs are a complete joke, all they do is make you work really hard on some fake project that a company will throw away.

Thank you so much <3 always happy to help anyway I can
I 100% get what you're saying, networking is an incredibly vague and abstract concept. I think it doesn't help that Cal kids lack formalized or institutionalized resources/support from the university, so we're mostly left to figure this out for ourselves.

I basically just checked out people's profiles on LinkedIn and reached out to anybody who seemed interesting. I was practically on a coffee chat every day, some of them in-person, but most over the phone/Face Time. I also attended alumni events over the weekend, and got to meet some awesome people in-person through fun social events.

If you want to learn more about networking, I'd definitely check out [some](https://bryanwang.substack.com/p/a-guide-to-authentic-networking) [of](https://www.cio.com/article/3219704/how-to-network-17-tips-for-shy-people.html) [these](https://link.ucop.edu/2020/04/14/share-with-your-network-tips-for-job-searching-during-covid-19/) [resources](https://career.berkeley.edu/Info/InfoInterview), and of course the best thing to do is just take that leap of faith and get a conversation rolling. Networking (rightfully) sounds snakey, but once you treat it like a conversation (and actually getting to know the person you're talking to) it can quickly evolve into pretty amazing friendships. I used to talk to my mentors about investment banking recruiting; now I'm helping them plan their engagement surprises and wedding plans, so I absolutely see networking as a win for both sides.

Feel free to DM + connect with me, and we can schedule some time to chat :)
Alum here. Honestly, if a Cal student reached out to me on LinkedIn and just said “hey I’m interested in M&A. Would you be willing to grab coffee and chat?” I would definitely reply and almost certainly make sure we met up soon.
Absolutely. I personally found my community in these kinds of org's, and have received so much love and support over the years. But it breaks my heart knowing this very community is exclusive, and doesn't intend to provide these resources and support to other students. I more than understand why this is the case, but that doesn't mean I'm happy about it. 

And I think we need to normalize non-membership in these clubs, at least in the context of finding fulfilling friend groups + jobs and internships. These student org's are by no means a golden ticket to the top internships/jobs, nor are they validation of one's worth and potential. Cal is a huge place, and while that makes it hard to navigate, there are countless communities one could be part of. I wish it was easier, but a huge part of finding those communities is putting yourself out there.
It honestly depends, IMO lots of them pretend they’re prestigious but, in reality, they beg their clients to work with them and also offer their work for free; that kind of attitude will surely lead to less impactful projects. 

There are a number of consulting clubs that do have their recommendations implemented (at least partly) and to produce solid revenue though, but that doesn’t mean they’re worth applying to either
Personally, I disagree...obviously if the org works with predominantly massive companies like FAANG+ or sth then it'll be hard to make something that they'll keep, but in my experience, orgs that work with smaller companies or startups can make a difference.

A lot of these small startups lack the brand name, but they'll often work with the club PMs at the beginning of the semester to craft a project that they'll actually keep. I won't sugarcoat it, because sometimes you'll be doing busy work, but I'll tell you that it feels good to see execs actually attend your final deliverable and discuss the merits of some of your ideas, then actually see some of them be implemented in the following few months
\^ they've been removed!
I think your blog post has a lot of useful advice. It feels really uncomfortable for me to initiate these conversations with a stranger but I’d be more than willing to be on the other side. 

Thanks for the offer to chat but I’d like to keep my reddit at least somewhat anonymous for now.
Out of curiosity, what universities DO have institutionalized support and resources to teach students how to network? I thought that was a systemic issue with all/most universities, not just Cal.
honestly I get that and five years down the line if someone hit me up for CS advice I’d be more than willing to meet up too. It’s just feels very very uncomfortable to me to be on the other end. I guess I gotta grow out of it :P
As an alum, this \^\^ 100%. I've personally been ghosted by plenty of alumni, but many more got back to me when I was a student and helped me get to where I am today. We need to stick together :)
No worries! And I definitely agree initiating is really, really tough. Call it lack of self-awareness or an over-abundance of self-confidence, but I think taking that initial plunge will vastly accelerate your appetite for networking. I more than respect your privacy, though -- just know my DM's are always open :)
I was definitely simplifying the problem, but there are a lot of key ways Cal underserves students in the recruiting scene. I'll also add that this analysis is *relative* to private schools, and the experiences my friends have had there (in contrast with mine and my friends' here at Cal). When compared to other *public* schools, though, we 100% have a leg-up (though that should be expected, considering we're comparatively well-funded and enjoy an amazing brand).

While we have a ""Career Center,"" it is severely underutilized by both students and administration. For instance, my friends in the Ivies, Stanford, etc. personally were *always* able to score 1:1 advising with dedicated career counselors to discuss professional goals and be personally connected to relevant alumni, professors, and grad students. These schools have dedicated staff constantly holding office hours for resume and cover letter review, mock interview sessions, and are 100% in-sync with alumni such that they can easily match make students with opportunities in any conceivable space they want. These schools also typically have tighter-knit alumni communities in the first place, and that is absolutely because they institutionally have stronger best practices securing alumni support (re: how many Cal alum do you know feel strongly enough about the university go give back?).

To make a long story short, networking is easy when you're spoon-fed contacts. And *this* is made easy by universities employing smart practices that actually serve the best interests of its students. I more than understand Cal is pretty resource-restrained, making it quite difficult to develop anything more robust than it already is. It's just that when you're practically forced to have to put yourself out there - with nothing but your name and what some may see a flimsy reliance on school pride - you can imagine the odds are stacked against you.
Thanks for the thoughtful response! That makes sense, especially the public versus private comparison. But how do you get such a huge institution to make meaningful change like that? That's not just rhetorical, I mean in reference to the reality that *how to change* any large system is a tough nut to crack. What's the answer, more staff, better communication? I wonder if it's easier to get help now that everything is online? No tables to man, lol!
Great questions! There is the question of *doing*, and then the separate one on *trying*. You're right; these are all insanely large, complex issues that will require years of systemic effort, funding, and strategic direction. I emphasize effort, though, because I think that's where our university is most lacking. 

I do believe, at the end of the day, you are responsible for your own growth and development. I personally am not a fan of how the Ivies hand-hold their students (for me, this is actually a huge reason why I'm proud of us Golden Bears). That being said, I'm certain our generous salary allocation for our football coach (among many, many other things) could be allocated instead to paying career counselors and major advisers more (re: increase retention, quality of service, etc.), expanding services under our Disabled Students Program for Career Services, etc. There are a lot of minute policy changes that need to be made, but I think the university is generally sluggish in addressing socioeconomic mobility and the need for high-paying jobs for high-caliber students like us. Considering income inequality creep and that cost of living (especially in the Bay) is outpacing wages, universities *must* do a better job preparing its students to succeed post-grad."
Cal Data Science VS UCSB Comp Eng vs UCI Comp Eng,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1c77qi9/cal_data_science_vs_ucsb_comp_eng_vs_uci_comp_eng/,2024-04-18 09:31:35,"Hi yall,
I’m trying to choose the best university for me. Would yall recommend Cal for data science or go to UCSB or UCI for computer engineering?

I like the UC Irvine area the most out of the 3 so location wise I like it the most but my education obviously more important than location since it’s only 4 years. 

Edit: looking to do SWE post graduation ","When I went to the UCSB admit day a few years ago, I told the students there that I was choosing between Cal, UCSB, and a couple of other schools. Every one of them advised me to go to Cal. lso, that ugly CompE building is a pox on that lovely UCSB campus. I know nothing about UCI but you should be able to get to SWE from any of these places. Cal will offer you the best data science education.
I graduated from Cal with a major in Data Science (chose an emphasis in mathematics), and I currently work as a SWE. 

I can’t speak comparatively to the other schools, but I do believe my education here set me up for success.

The professors here are brilliant and phenomenal. Besides all of them being super smart and accomplished, several are also great teachers - which is a notable distinction. The ones that still come to mind are Prof. Denero, Prof. Hug, Prof. Adhikari, and several others. The content at Cal is incredibly rigorous and challenging, and it genuinely taught me how to learn and apply ideas in new ways.

Besides the education itself, Cal as a whole makes available a wide variety of different opportunities to success that I’m not sure you’d be able to find at other institutions. I never pursued an SWE internship prior to graduation, but I participated in research projects in the latter half of my undergraduate education which I feel helped set me up for my entry into the industry. I met classmates working on research across a variety of different domains like bio, climate, and physics, which I thought was incredibly neat.

This might be a more subtle aspect, but the students at Cal are also incredibly smart. During my time there, I definitely felt very average, if not oftentimes below-average - which I feel was a positive. If you’ve got a question, odds are good there’ll be classmates who are happy to help and know how to guide you to the solution. In-person and (especially) online discussions always felt really active and alive, and by extension, made them really engaging and helpful.

The one caveat I’d note is that I think the Data Science program has evolved since I graduated in 2021 due to budgeting constraints. I was fortunate enough to not have too much issue enrolling in some of the “hotter” classes that cross into the EECS program such as Intro to ML, Databases, Optimization Models, and Cybersecurity, but I’m not sure what the situation for this looks to current or prospective students.
What are you looking to do? SWE?
I have similar options, albeit a different major. I’m choosing cal 🙂 originally from SoCal
UCI CE! I work with many UCI alum and there are a lot of opportunities for CE developers.
DS + Math major here. No problem securing tech internships if you play your cards right. In regards to classes, we'll have to make do with other department equivalents, though we have limited seats in 170,188,189 which are more than enough. You can still take EECS126/127 or INDENG160/162 to get in those fields. You can also take some of the hotter CS classes in summer when there are no reserved seats.
Yeah
Oh nice! I’m from SoCal too!
Oh that’s cool! If you don’t mind me asking, what does your job entail in terms of working with CE developers?

thank u!
Have you taking 172? If so, do you need to know Multivariable calculus for IND ENG 172? Also, do the homework come from textbook problems?
I’m taking it right now. There is some calculus, including multi variable, but it’s not foundational to the course or anything, so you should be fine. Homework does come from the textbook, but you can find the textbook for free online.
If you have taken data 140 and/or data 100. How would you compare them with stat 159? I'm planning on taking it next semester. Do you also recommend it in general?

The civ eng department has really cool and fun clubs. They’re really inclusive. In my experience, you really don’t need to apply. You just show up to the meetings and work away on your project. 

Here is a link with all the clubs: https://www.asce.berkeley.edu/teams-and-organizations

Concrete canoe, for example, builds an entire canoe out of concrete then race it against other school. Steel bridge builds an entire bridge out of steel and then have a competition against other schools (where the bridge that can support the heaviest load wins). There is also transportation challenges, seismic design challenges, etc. 

The best part? Well there are many! The people in the clubs are so nice and awesome. They rarely reject people (from my knowledge) AND you don’t even have to be a civ eng major to join these clubs. Anyone Is welcomed
CHAOS and cal climbing!!!
Art and Mind club! We destress with art therapy on different outdoor spaces on campus. Open to all! The insta is @artandmind.Berkeley

You forget Cal Construction. I just came from regional competition yesterday.
I had zero knowledge about construction 3 months before. Our club is inclusive to new members even though we don't win trophies. Cal Poly wins awards because they don't allow new members to compete.
Where would you get info and access to these types of clubs?

Did Oppenheimer teach any undergraduate physics courses during time at Cal?

I’m curious as my late father was an engineering major at Berkeley from 1932 to 1936. I thumbed thru his Cal yearbook (1936) but no mention or pics of Oppenheimer.

Just wondering could Oppenheimer have taught freshman physics?
Whereabouts is it? You can also find the room where they used a cyclotron to discover Plutonium on the upper floor of Lewis Hall. There's a small plaque commemorating it.
Why have I never visited! Is this even advertise in LeConte?
Where is old Le Conte Hall?
[deleted]
This is a loose guess, but i want to say Oppenheimer is the tall dude in the middle and Lawrence is the older guy in the white apron (w/glasses but no hat). I could be wrong but i know I’ve seen pics before, even if i wasn’t playing close attention.

Edit: looks like i’m 0 for 2. Thanks for playing y’all.
That’s neat, I’ll check it out if I’m back for the fall. Oppenheimer’s office is on the 3rd floor of Old LeConte on the rear corridor if I’m not mistaken.
Do you know when they made this known? I must have walked past it many times 20 years ago banging my head off the wall with upper div physics homework sets and had no idea. To be fair I would was probably too stressed out to notice the plaque even if it was there.
@diamondketo It’s a surprisingly well kept secret by the department lol. @beastmodecowboy The LeConte you enter from the Campanille side is actually LeConte extension. The original building is accessed from the entrance on Oppenheimer way (the lane between Tan Kah Kee hall and Campbell hall that ends in the Hearst mining circle). Only the staircase at this entrance will take you to the offices in Old LeConte  Alternatively, you can go to the top floor of LeConte extension and take the connecting corridor to Old LeConte opposite the Physics and Astronomy library. This will take you straight to the 3rd floor of Old LeConte. Old LeConte was renovated after the extension was built so it actually looks newer inside.
>doubt 

I go to Berkeley currently and don't really see hippies
What about the guy smoking the pipe on top with the blown up black hair? He resembles Oppenheimer more, and he was extremely known for smoking
Not sure about Oppenheimer, but Ernest Lawrence is sitting bottom row just left of center, with his leg crossed over, and to the right (his left) of the guy with the apron
I don't, unfortunately. Although, to my eyes, one of the plaques did not exactly look very new. I think there might be a grad student lounge up on the same floor or something, and maybe an office or two. Other than that, it's really out of the way and the corridor is dark and dingy. The door is locked and impossible to see into, too.
Oppenheimer is indeed up top with a pipe in his mouth. A true signature.
I misread your post. I was talking about LeConte but I probably banged my head off the wall in Lewis at some point too!"

I am taking CE 93 this upcoming spring semester and I was wondering if y’all have any tips/advice for success in this course? Also, how would y’all rate this class in terms of difficulty?","If it’s with Hansen, good luck bc he doesn’t teach at all. Read the textbook and go to the GSI office hours as much as you can. Make a note sheet/study guide throughout the course of the semester as you learn more and more so you can keep track of all the important concepts. I can’t comment too much on difficulty bc the semester I took it was when we converted to online, but the first midterm which was in person was not too bad.
I’m also taking CE 93, would love to form a study group if you’re interested!
Personally, I did a lot of practice problems from the textbook in addition to the homework. That helped me the most for the midterms. I see that the professor is Hansen which I’ve heard doesn’t teach well so I’m not sure how helpful he’ll be in office hours :( if the GSI is good I would suggest going to their office hours. Also finding people in the class to work on homework and study with is also great!
Thanks for your response!
Sounds great!
Are the practice problems and homework problems similar to Hansen’s exams ?
I’m also taking ce93! Can I be in your group too
I didn’t have Hansen so I’m not sure about his exams. For the exams I took, they mainly helped with concepts. I think some were similar and some weren’t

Could you please suggest an alternative L&S breadth if i am unable to get Data C8? I am interested in taking an economics or business course. Also is math 53 doable in first semester?","^^i heavily don’t recommend taking E7 your first semester
 I would try to get your American Cultures done if you’re looking for a humanity! (the college of engineering doesn’t do breadths like L&S, just a few requirements) I took Anthro 3AC and it was chill. My first sem I took Chem 1a, data 8,  math 53 (def doable), and the one unit intro civE class (highly recommend that class)
Seems like the easy choice is to take E7 if Data 8 is filled up.  Econ 1 can be taken, as a breadth would be fulfilled.  Double check though to see if you’re eligible to take the course (1st semester students may or may not be able to take this, not sure).  You could also take something like UGBA 10 purely as an elective.
hey can please tell me the what E7 stands for?"
Difference between Applied Math and Engineering Math and Statistics?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/a9gkij/difference_between_applied_math_and_engineering/,2018-12-25 09:28:59,Both seem to have the same requirements except one is BA in L&S and the other is in COE. Are there any other real differences between the two that I might be missing?,"not really. one is in coe so you have different requirements to complete 
Applied Math requires a concentration of some kind (a sequence of courses in some coherent topic of your choice, e.g. differential equations, optimization, stochastic processes, etc..).

Eng Math & Stats has additional lower division physical science requirements (Physics 7A / 7B, possibly Chem 1A/1AL.)

Edit: For Eng Math & Stats, you can find the curriculum details by looking at the degree worksheet. The 2018 requirements can be found here (https://engineering.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/docs/ems-worksheet-2018.pdf).

For Applied Math, I don’t think there is a similar “worksheet”. I think this is because the L&S breadth requirements take so much time.

Overall, I get the impression that Eng Math & Stats allows you to focus much more on technical material (mostly by having fewer breadth requirements).
Engineering math and stats is required to take a few physics and CS courses. You also get to choose between real analysis 2 or complex analysis. The math major is required to take complex. You will also take one course in probability (which hardly constitutes adding ""statistics"" to the name of the program). 

&#x200B;

There is a lot of overlap in the upper division coursework (110, 104, 128A, and potentially complex analysis). The applied math major will also take an algebra course, which is more traditionally ""mathy"". 

&#x200B;

Overall, I would say that as engineering math, more of your units are ""locked in,"" especially during your lower division courses, but you don't have ""engineering"" courses like the other engineering majors do.

Hidden gems in Berkeley?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/e3yklr/hidden_gems_in_berkeley/,2019-11-30 08:01:58,"Hey! I'm an incoming UCEAP exchange student who will be studying at Berkeley for the Spring 2020 semester. Seeing as I'm only going to be at Berkeley for one semester, I'm keen on experiencing as much as possible while I'm there.

What do you think are the most undervalued experiences at Berkeley? Cool things to check out / clubs to look into?  (Or things to avoid :P) I'm open to non-campus activity suggestions as well!

I'm also thinking about getting some work experience of some sort that might help me in the long-run in terms of the career search (Think internships or part-time jobs). Unfortunately, I will be limited by my J-1 visa, so I'd really appreciate it if anyone has any pointers as to where to look- there seems to be a ton of information online, to the point where it's a little overwhelming.

Obligatory go bears!","Welcome!  I just moved here a couple months ago and still discovering more of Berkeley myself.  Here are some of the hidden gems or experiences I've found since being here:

* Stunning views from Grizzly Peak or the Lawrence Hall of Science.  
* Berkeley Rose Garden for the scenery and Indian Rock Park to do some neighborhood rock climbing
* Rooftop swimming pool at Hearst Gym.  It's absolutely beautiful ([https://recsports.berkeley.edu/hearst-pool/](https://recsports.berkeley.edu/hearst-pool/))
* Join a pickup ultimate frisbee game (seems like kids in Bay Area love ultimate)
* Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive is a great local art museum with events happening every weekend.
* Berkeley Marina has the Cal sailing club and other water activities (kayaking, paddleboard)
* Stroll down Telegraph Ave for the student food and shopping experience.  Downtown, North Berkeley, and Elmwood for the more upscale food and shopping.  

You're also a 30 min train ride from Berkeley into San Francisco.  Make sure you explore the big city along with checking out what Berkeley has to offer.  


I'm not a UCB student, but it seems they'd have a student club for any activity you enjoy or ever had an itch to try.   I imagine folks can point you in the right direction to whatever you'd like to join.    


Best of luck on your upcoming semester!
Hey, if you like Harry Potter and playing sports, we have a quidditch team! People rag on us for being a bunch of nerds, but it's actually a really fun sport and there is a lot chill people on the team! Its very casual game, we do have tournaments but you don't have to sign up for those if you don't wanna be competitive and you can show up to how ever many practices you want to! We also have a very active social side outside of practice. All around a great way to meet a lot of new people!
If you like to read, check out the Friends of the Berkeley Public Library  Bookstore on the ground floor of the parking garage between Durant and Channing, just west of Telegraph. 

It's easy to miss, but worth a few minutes' perusal of the great selection of near-new books massively discounted from their original prices. Many books cost only a quarter, and there are usually free books behind the store, near the elevators.
If you're looking to do research, I recommend you apply for a URAP (undergraduate research apprenticeship program) project. The applications open around the beginning of each semester and close pretty quickly, so be aware of deadlines (if you're planning on applying).
If this is your first time I would recommend going to Sliver Pizza or The Cheese Board at least once while you stay here. Those are places that are very well recognized by the Berkeley community and you would miss out by not going to at least one of the two.

Depending on if you are someone who plays video games or Magic the Gathering there is a cool place off of Shattuck called Eudemonia which is essentially an internet cafe. It also hosts magic the Gathering tournaments and you can buy board games and stuff if you are interested.

Lastly, my personal favorite is this place while not in Berkeley it is still very cool. Right behind the Costco, there is firstly Point Isabel for dog walkers and also this ""Beach"" which is full of ceramics. I love to look at all the broken and smoothed out pieces trying to find their logo. There used to be a ceramics factory called Tepco when they shut down all their extra was dumped into the bay.
Hike to the Big C or go to the top of the Campanile. I love the views!
The suggestions here are fantastic! I'll second the Campanile since so many people skip it... I definitely think the most undervalued thing is not exploring the city and the Bay! 

The rumors / jokes are true: If you love food (how can you not!), then this is a fantastic place to be! Both fantastic cheap and fancy options exist, so don't feel the pressure to blow your budget on food. However, no one will fault you if you spend a little to much on some fancy experience.

I'll highlight a few things: 

* Walk around a lot. There's much to see on foot that you miss even by bus.
   * A particularly fun walk: College Ave (from Campus) to Lake Merritt / downtown Oakland. It's a few miles long but pretty easy. If you do it in a day you could plan amazing breakfast/lunch/dinner options along the way. 
* Don't limit yourself to Berkeley! Other suggestions for SF are great, but also checkout  Oakland! It takes some effort, but the North and South Bay both have cool experiences, but you'll want to target those more directly. (Mostly because of time/sprawl.)
* Oakland: Lake Merritt, shows at Fox/Greek, plenty of amazing food options. 
* SF: Exploratorium is a really fun science museum and it's pretty interactive. Don't just think it's for kids.
   * Angel Island has fun hiking an some interesting history. (It once held immigration detention centers)
   * Presidio is fun to walk through
* North Bay: Muir Woods, Point Bonita lighthouse, Point Reyes Lighthouse. (All these require a car.)
Go to a show at the Greek Theater once. Also, I went to a play at the Shotgun Players Theater and it was phenomenal! There’s also lots of good hiking in the area, just google hiking trails. California in general is known for its redwoods; most people want to go up to John Muir, but Redwood Regional Park is right here in the east bay and tends to get slept on (not literally slept on, just means people tend to forget about it). I don’t know that it’s a hidden gem but I went to Angeline’s for an anniversary dinner and it was    *b o m b*.

Truth be told, I lived in SF  for a lot longer than I’ve lived in the east bay, so I have more suggestions for that. But as for UCB I’d say just put yourself out there and meet as many people as you can and check out anything that seems like it might be interesting.

I was about to say Cal sailing! It's $90 for 3 months but if you can make Thursday racing they feed you after and I think it balances out. They race right before and around sunset so the views are fantastic and the other racers are really friendly even if a bit eccentric. Sailing's pretty easy to pick up if you can swim and aren't afraid of the water. They have Saturday morning practices, and I really love walking along the marina in general around sunset!
I second this list!
Just adding to this, there's a soccer field above the Golden Bear Rec. Center (Cal's Men's and Women's NCAA gymnastics team training center) Which is just above the hill from Clark Kerr campus.  It has a clear view of SF and most of the Bay.

Also, never pass up an opportunity to see a show at the Greek Theater if you can afford it.
This list is amazing!! Totaly recommend everything here. I also like Tilden Park trails/Lake Anza and really want to check out the Aftel Archive of Curious Scents
To add to this, there's also Solano Ave and near Indian Rock and Fourth St in West Berkeley for upscale shopping. A great coffee shop called Artis is in that area as well. West Berkeley also houses a number of breweries, and a sake tasting room. If you like plants, there are a few fun nurseries to wander around in like Cactus Jungle, Flowerland, Berkeley Horticulture, and East Bay Nursery. Flowerland also hosts a little coffee trailer for Highwire Coffee. Also very good.

You're also a stones throw away from Oakland Chinatown, Lake Merritt, and Jack London Square. Plenty more things to explore in Oakland too!
[deleted]
Second this! 

I go in there at the beginning of every semester and get some free books

I would also recommend Moe's on Telegraph or  Pegesus on Shattuck!
Oh hey, I thought I was the only one who knew about this! There are places like this all over the Richmond part of the Bay-- I would specifically recommend Point Molate, as it has tons of ceramics from when it was occupied by Chinese workers in the late 1800s. Also found a prehistoric projectile point there once, that was wack.
>Sliver

No. Sorry Berkeley, that is not a good pie. Cheese Board is though.

Also near that Costco is the Albany bulb, highly highly recommend for some really great local artwork.
Also Little Star Pizza, if you like a good cornmeal crust!
If you have an oven, don't wait in line to get the Cheeseboard Pizza, go next door to their bakery/cheese shop and ask for a half-baked one at the front, and finish baking it at home.
Not OP, I've just recently started actually visiting SF even though I've lived in the East Bay my whole life. I'd love to see your suggestions for there!
rip
god your manners are awful
Haha, I realise my post was littered with grammar mistakes. English isn't my first language, and I wrote this pretty late at night. Hopefully my post was clear enough though
Oh shit dude, you figured us out, but we only do sewage sword fights on the 3rd friday of every month cause people get busy. Quidditch is a gateway habit, but like I can quit whenever I want.
I especially love looking through all the pieces to find an intact name of the company. I think I'ts great that other people know about small places like this. Its part of what gives the bay area such rich history.
Seconding the Bulb (and it's worth looking up its history, before or after going)
I would like to politely disagree based on the history of Cheese Board and Sliver. Each serves their own audience. Sliver is more for younger people and has its own intricacies. While Cheese Board is more for an older more mature audience. It would also be good to mention that Sliver branched off from Cheese Board and is therefore still very good and recognized.
Okay! Kind of a no brainer, but Golden Gate Park is a gift to us all. There’s so much to do there. The Academy of Sciences has a nightlife event for adults on certain Thursdays that are pretty fun. They have themes and I think I went to an exceptionally popular one so it was kind of hyphey, but it was fun. There’s also the de Young Museum, Hardly Strictly music festival, there’s freaking *bison* there, Stow Lake. Stern Grove is also lovely and has free concerts in the summer. 

If you like creepy stuffed dead things like I do, Paxton Gate in the Mission is really fun to walk around in, as is Loved to Death in the Haight. Both of those neighborhoods have lots of good food while you’re there, too. Too many to name tbh, so I’ll just name one for each I can personally vouch for: Universal Cafe in the Mission and Magnolia in the Haight, but google places to eat in these areas and you’ll find something good.

The Ferry Building is fun to walk around in, especially when you go when the Farmer’s Market is going on because it’s huge. Seriously it’s massive and it’s fun walking around, sampling things and people watching and maybe buying some groceries or oysters.

Fisherman’s Wharf is mostly a tourist trap but Musee Mechanique is fun and you can get some old school film strip photos of yourself. It’s near North Beach which has City Lights Bookstore, a bunch of bomb Italian food. Its the neighborhood the Beat Generation used to hang out in, so the Jack Kerouacs and Allen Ginsbergs. If you drink (or if you don’t but are over 21 and like history and don’t mind just having a soda) Spec’s Twelve Adler Museum is a fun quirky bar where I know they used to haunt. Not too too far away by Coit Tower are the Greenwich Steps. I mean not much to say about those, they’re just some beautiful ass garden steps with a fantastic view, it feels like you stepped out of the city.

*Speaking of* beautiful ass steps, Grand View Park in the Sunset has *two* of them leading up to it (Moraga Steps and 16th Ave Steps) and one of the best views of the city once you get to the top. The Sunset also has lots and lots of fantastic Asian food, and I lived there for 8 years so I will name some of it now: San Tung (dry fried wings and black bean noodles), Izakaya Sozai (their ramen is some of the best in the city but honestly anything), Szechuan Cuisine, Thanh Long. Honestly there’s so many, and plenty of other good food there, too. Land’s End is worth checking out while you’re in the area, too.

This is getting long so I’ll wrap it up for now by mentioning a seasonal item: go check out Tom and Jerry’s Christmas House, I think it’s in the Castro. They’re a couple (yes their names are really Tom and Jerry) that decorate their house uh... pretty thoroughly for Christmas every year. Pretty sure you should be able to google map it. And while you’re in the Castro, may as well party. Have fun!
Oh yeah, not San Francisco but not too far, I just saw a post about Half Moon Bay and was reminded of it: the best Taco Bell in the country is in HMB and you should go to it.
Can I ask what it is about Sliver and Cheese Board that makes you say they go for a younger and more mature audience, respectively? I don’t really think of pizza as being divisive in that way so I’m having trouble thinking how they would differ.
Cheese Board is a worker owned collective, while Sliver is a chain that is copying the Cheese Board and Arizmendi style pizzas. The person who started the Sliver chain was actually asked to leave Cheese Board.
It's mostly because Sliver is right next to two Berkeley High and UC Berkeley while Cheese Board is farther away in the residential neighboorhood. So the Cheese Board audience is more families for rather than kids trying to get lunch
That makes much more sense. I was trying to figure how pizza could possibly differ much for an older vs younger crowd and I was breaking my brain.
Yeah less about the pizza and more about the vibe at the actual location lol
Yeah, makes sense. I was like I guess pizza for old people could be like... softer?"

No problem! You just need to drop it before the start of the session. It’s a cancellation, not a withdrawal since it’s before the cancellation deadline. They also waived this year’s cancellation fee!

"If I am graduating in May, do I have to get the booster?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/suxvq7/if_i_am_graduating_in_may_do_i_have_to_get_the/,2022-02-17 12:03:43,"Too lazy to deal with Cal bureaucracy, so I'm turning to r/berkeley to get public Reddit opinion.

To preface this, I had Omicron during the first week of this semester, had very mild symptoms. I also had COVID in January 2021. I received an email from the University saying that if I do not get my booster shot by March 1, then I will have an academic hold placed on my CalCentral account. However, due to having COVID twice, I'm not very keen on getting the booster shot so soon. I received the J&J vaccine in May 2021, and I just think I would rather wait a while to get the booster, especially if I still presumably have the antibodies from falling ill to COVID once again a few weeks ago. I also am a bit worried about the side effects of the booster, as I can't afford to fall even further behind in school.

I know this would be a no-brainer if I had more semesters left at Cal, but I am graduating this May, and so I'm not sure how this academic hold would potentially affect me. Would I still be able to graduate in May if the University placed an academic hold on my CalCentral account, presumably for not getting my booster? Or would I be straight up barred from graduation?","Well, if you want to walk you might. I graduated Winter 2021 and you had to display that green campus access badge to enter the stadium, which means you had to have had your booster. 

Idk if that’s gonna change by May or not but might be wise to get it if you’re attending the commencement ceremony.
Your ""natural immunity"" will wane in a few months and you could be vulnerable again. 

Without a booster you'll be more likely to catch and pass COVID to someone else, like an immunocompromised cashier who is just trying to survive and pay the rent, or an older professor who is not as robust as you are physically. 

It sounds like there is something causing you to resist getting the shot. Please look deeply and honestly into yourself and think about why you don't want the booster. Do you hate needles? Worried about pain? Or the side effects? Is it the inconvenience of finding an appointment? There are ways to get support for all of these issues. Talk to someone you trust about what your reasons are, and then be a good person and get it, if not for yourself then for others.
Just get the vaccine already. Studies are showing a better protection from the vaccine than the disease, so just do it.
Nah you don’t
i don’t think you have to
If you wait more, the booster won’t even work against the Covid strains circulating then. Taking it NOW will allow you to build more immunity to current variants, and be spaced out from the upcoming omicron-specific booster being tested by Pfizer now. You sound so lazy and entitled. It’s easy to get the vaccine. Show up to a Walgreens. It’s free. The side effects of the third shot are almost nonexistent. People like you are what are keeping us in this pandemic.
Thanks for the insight.
[deleted]
There are also studies that say protection from the infection is better than the vaccine. I’m boosted by the way.
What if I just don’t want to get the booster right now?
sweet
I went to two walk-in clinics a few weeks ago to try and get my booster; I was turned away from both. Also, the vaccines aren't even working? Even if everybody were to get all their vaccines, COVID would still be running its course. You can't just call somebody who is apprehensive to get their booster after having COVID twice lazy and entitled. You realize how ridiculous that sounds?
[deleted]
how are you a university student?
Oops, sounds like you expressed an opinion which the woke mob here on Berkeley reddit does not approve of. Lol i cant wait to be done with this place
I study immunity for my PhD. Therefore, I know what I’m talking about. The vaccine doesn’t prevent infection, it reduces the risk of developing severe diseases. If everyone got vaccinated on time, we’d prevent community spread so much better. In addition, vaccines naturally require boosters. You take four doses of the polio vaccine in 6 months to develop immunity from it. Also, vaccines are NEVER perfect. They get the job done, though. I’m sorry you got infected twice. Also re: not finding boosters: That was a few weeks ago. You can literally just walk into UCSF’s community clinics and get vaccinated. You can walk into any community clinic hosted by Alameda County and get boosted. Make an appointment on CVS website. In the height of the booster request surge I was able to get an appointment for two days later in the downtown BERKELEY Walgreens.

And no, I don’t sound crazy. I spent my entire life studying immunity and immune responses. I grew up in a third world country where vaccines are hard to find, and my parents had to travel across the entire city to try and get me vaccinated. I know the struggle of vaccination. I’ve lived it. Therefore I have the right to call vaccine hesitant people who don’t have valid concerns “entitled”. Because that’s what they are.

Just because Covid is still around doesn’t mean we should be okay with not vaccinating and developing a deadly illness. The vaccine saves lives. It’s proven.
Or you can either get the booster or accept that you may not be able to participate if rules are kept in place by graduation. You know, like an adult…
if the vaccine doesnt prevent infection/transmission, doesnt that make getting the vaccine more of a personal safety measure than a public safety one? are you upset with OP because they are not protecting themselves, or do you believe that the vaccines will mitigate the transmission of the virus?
The general public is increasing in vaccination rate. It doesn’t prevent transmission as much, but it still does. It decreases viral load in the nasal passages, which is how it mainly spreads. We can use it to mitigate community spread if we all are on board with vaccination. Early data is showing this.
yes that makes sense, thanks! hopefully this early data turns out to be true and the vaccines can reduce spread
Fingers crossed! I’m very cautious but optimistic. Hopefully we’re at the tail end of Covid."
Is this a theoretically valid schedule for an L&S CS major trying to graduate in three years?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dlseh9/is_this_a_theoretically_valid_schedule_for_an_ls/,2019-10-22 18:53:36,"https://imgur.com/a/3nSskpJ

I'm basically trying to see if my understanding of graduation requirements is correct Also, what are the advantages and disadvantages of graduating in three years?","We have very similar schedule plans; I’m also an L&S CS freshman planning to graduate in 3 years - feel free to PM me for my plan
What you have is the minimum required to graduate in 3 years, or even possibly 2.5 years if you did a 5 4 4 4 4 schedule.  It looks accurate to me.  Some classes might require a prereq that could add to the number of classes needed.  More for your own benefit. For example, CS 189 for the most part requires Math 53.  Most upper div social science classes require a lower division class though it’s probably not enforced.

My kid has exactly the same sched, eexcept he’s double majoring in DS in order to cover breadths and to get more CS courses in.  His is a much more stressful sched because he’s taking 4 every semester and all his breadths are already finished, but still will finish in 3. There’s a potentially big disadvantage in this type of schedule, which is that you’re pretty compelled to find a good internship at the end of your second year instead of 3rd year.  One may or may not be ready at that point, especially since a lot of recruiting is done in the fall. Theoretically you could/should be ready after CS61B, but more realistically you would be more ready after CS170 and perhaps after more specialty course(s) like 161/186/189.  You might not get to CS170 and some of the other courses until your 3rd year or perhaps end of 2nd year.  And if Prof DeNero is your adviser he will try really hard to convince you to go 4 years lol.
One very important thing - with 19 classes that’s 76 units, and Math and English AP credits gives you around 10.5 more.  Do you have 34 additional credits of AP/CC in order to graduate?  If not, that’s more classes you’ll have to fit in.
I'm planning 3.5, which is way more than feasible. But I can definitely think of ways I could've saved time, and I came in without Math 1B completed.

You can do that??
You should do EECS 126 instead of EECS 127 if you plan on doing only one of the two, it's much more useful for 189
Yep absolutely
Alright thanks
Advisor for what tho

When we do we get this advisor
For EECS and declared CS majors, they get to choose a Faculty advisor.  Pretty much can be anyone in the EECS domain, but obviously you want to get someone that fits in with you you want to do.  All the Faculty will have a list of things that they specialize in. You and your advisor get to meet just before registration time each semester to go over life, classes,  future, etc.

**Math 1B**. (It's a requirement for CS. I already have the AP Score necessary to test out of 1A. Not too shabby at math).

**Chem 1A and 1AL.** (Taking as a pre-med requirement)

**Data 8.** (Want to brush up on programming skills to prepare for CS61A. Also really like John DeNero's teaching style!)

**Economics 1.** (Really interested in economics. It also fulfills my social sciences breadth requirement. I definitely want to take a business class)

Lmk how hard my schedule is, and if I'm on track to reaching my goals. Thanks!!","I would figure out what you hope to get out of Berkeley before you submit yourself to the brutality of 4 techs. You can’t be a coding doctor investment banker. If you want med school you need a high gpa and research and you likely won’t have time if you’re swamped with techs and lengthy cs projects. Med schools will not care you did cs so if it’s just a back up I would look at DS instead since you can take more chill classes and can do the bio related focus
That is a packed schedule, especially with both Chem 1A and 1AL in the mix. I would hold off on Econ until another semester, especially if this is your first sem at Cal, since it's important to land on your feet once you get here and to maintain a proper work/life balance. For prereqs in competetive STEM majors, you need to work extra and attend your section, office hours, GSI office hours, study sessions both official and unofficial, etc. You've chosen pretty much only classes with that environment, and that makes it harder for you to end up with a high grade. It's doable, but really difficult and probably not necessary considering you still have 8 semesters (and 2-3 summers!) ahead of you.
have not taken a business class so i cannot attest to whether econ 1 is a prereq for any. 

That being said, if you’re really interested in economics, and you’re premed and cs, working a ground up foundation in econ from econ 1 seems like kind of a waste. I would say take something else (either a non tech breadth, or another premed req if you’re up for it so you can hit more upper divs earlier) and take an upper div econ class later—you’ll pick up a lot of econ in that. I personally enjoyed econ 157, healthcare economics. I had taken ap macro 3 years prior to that, so i was basically entering knowing vaguely what supply and demand were and not much else. Did very well and learned a lot, am glad i took that over an intro econ class. If you’re into business, take a business class that doesn’t have a hard econ prereq and brush up on econ in your spare time. 

if you’re looking to go to med school you’ll probably want to take psych and or soc at some point, both will also fill social science.
How about this instead? CS10, Math 1B, Art 32AC, Chem 1A/1AL
I don't know too much about CS10 or Art 32AC but that seems a lot better imo than your OP schedule. Check out the Berkeleytime website for grade distributions as well. All the best"

Schedule question for MechE major trying to switch into EECS or CS (plz help),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/okc48i/schedule_question_for_meche_major_trying_to/,2021-07-14 12:50:12,"okay so this is kinda complicated. I am trying to switch into EECS, however my adviser said that they may implement a policy next summer that would disallow anyone from switching into that major. The good thing, though, is that I believe the CS major in L&S has the same requirements (3.3 in CS61A, 61B, and 70), so I am planning to just take those courses and see what happens. So, as a mechE major I have 15 units of technical electives which those courses fall under. I must take 2 technical courses towards my major each semester, so I’m planning on taking this schedule:

Math 53
Film R1B (or an equivalent R&C B course)
CS61A

My question is: will this schedule get an enrollment block, or are both the technicals I’m taking counting towards my major? It has been so hard to get advice on this since my adviser is so hard to contact and hasn’t given me great advice. If you have any other valuable advice plz plz plz lmk.","Umm not sure if the policy is set for sure since my advisor didn't know anything about that. But, regarding your question, yes you will probably have some sort of block for next semester and possibly a restriction from changing your major based on my advisor since you are not taking 2 technical classes in your CURRENT major.
I think your sched is ok since you are taking two techs and both are making progress towards both majors.  CS61A is an allowable elective for ME, so I think that should count. There’s a tiny possibility you may need to add something like Physics 7A or Chem 1A to your proposed Fall sched, in the unlikely event that electives don’t count. But you should definitely check with an ESS advisor.
do technical electives not count as technicals toward your major?
okay thank you so much. Is it crazy to do 3 technical courses or is that a normal thing?
I assume they do. Is 61A a technical elective for MechE?
It really depends on what the combo of classes are, how organized the person taking them is, what grade they are looking for, and if you want to spend your first semester doing a lot of social activities.  Some people have problems taking more than 1 technical, while others take 4 or more with no issues.  Many take the minimum 12 or 13 units, but if you search thru this sub, you’ll see a few students taking 24-28 units.  I would think that CS61A, Math 53 and say Physics 7A is a decent workload, but not anywhere near impossible.
hey did you end up switching in?
Yes 

> **Up to three units of technical elective credit may be lower division and may be chosen from the following approved lower division courses**: ASTRON 7A, ASTRON 7B, BIO ENG 10, BIOLOGY 1A plus BIOLOGY 1AL, BIOLOGY 1B, CHEM 1B, CHEM 3A, CHEM 3B, CHEM 4B, CIV ENG 11, CIV ENG 60, CIV ENG 70, CIV ENG 93, COMPSCI C8/DATA C8/INFO C8/STAT C8, **COMPSCI 61A, COMPSCI 61B, COMPSCI 61C, COMPSCI 70, DES INV 15, DES INV 90E, EECS 16B**, ENGIN 11, EPS 50, INTEGBI C32, MATH 55, MAT SCI 45, MCELLBI 32, PHYSICS 7C, STAT 20, STAT 21.

I’m currently in my second semester of fulfilling the requirements, but if i dont mess up too bad in any of my classes I’ll successfully switch after this semester!"
Nick Weaver's COVID analysis: Good News,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/lrkahv/nick_weavers_covid_analysis_good_news/,2021-02-24 10:50:26,"Previously I've posted updates on how I've viewed the COVID situation, future planning, and related issues, because I think it is important to be transparent with my students.  

I also make sure to cross post it to reddit because it is general interest, not just for students in the classes I'm teaching (CS61C and CS161 this semester)

TL:DR:  The news is excellent and I am confident I'll see everyone in the fall.

ObDisclaimers:  I don't speak for the University, and I am not an epidemiologist.

Everyone should know from the past that I have been ""calculated gloom"" on COVID, doing such things as cancelling in-person activity for 61C last year the day before the University decided to do so.  I am now ""calculated relieved"": the current news is fantastic. 

Despite the selection pressure that has resulted in far more contagious strains, the January lockdown worked and case rates are now back down to the ""below the Thanksgiving & Christmas Super-Spreader Charlie Foxtrot"".  More important we are now at the >10% vaccination rate which should really really reduce the fatality rate going forward.  I actually hope to be able to visit my parents in person over spring break, since I'm no longer worried I might accidentally kill them if it turns out I have COVID when I meet them since they went to Disneyland recently...

And the vaccine rollout, although rocky at the start, is finally going.  The Bay Area now has multiple mass-vaccination sites run by the state, since the ""shove it off on counties"" strategy really didn't work.  We have two mRNA 2-dose vaccines approved, and the J&J one-dose is almost certain to be approved within weeks.

Even mutations aren't that scary: the mRNA vaccines still offer protection from serious COVID on the mutant strains and both Moderna and Pfizer are already designing/testing booster-patches with the changed spikes and the FDA has already announced this will be a flu-shot style approval process.

Furthermore, ""the vaccine doesn't necessarily prevent people from being contagious"" is poor messaging:  For this to be the case you would have to have a significant number of vaccinated people who have significant viral replication but don't get sick at ALL, since the 95% effectiveness measure for the mRNA vaccines is symptomatic COVID.

This is overly cautious messaging and, although after vaccination I will still probably wear a mask out of politeness, mass vaccination really is going to protect everyone, not just the vaccinated.  But at the same time, the mRNA vaccines are so good that a significant fraction refusing the vaccination will not be as damaging as it could be.

As such I have high confidence that Fall will be in person. 

If one of the vaccines receives full approval (rather than the current emergency-use-authorization) I'd bet that UC will require it but until it is off EUA I doubt they can.  But you should get vaccinated anyway when you can.

Additionally, all of us who work for UC are currently vaccine eligible (this includes TAs, readers, work-study arrangements etc): it counts as education.  At the same time, supply is still temporarily constrained, with 5000 dose specialized sites having every appointment booked up in 24 hours.

Since I'm still able to work remote and my risk factor is only ERRR (0.5% fatality rate) rather than URG or OHMERGOHD, I'm not going for heroic efforts to get jabbed.  But as soon as it isn't so insanely supply constrained I'm going to get vaccinated and 1 week after my second dose I will be resuming on-campus activity with in-person drop-in office hours on Wednesdays in addition to the Tuesday/Thursday by-zoom office hours.

So yes, we are seeing the dawn.  Things are looking up.","Thanks for your updates Nick! Really appreciate the information you collect for us. My roommate volunteers on campus so she's hopefully gonna get the vaccine soon, I'm a TA but I'll wait it out to let more at-risk people get it. Feeling more positive for Fall too!
What are the odds that the current vaccine would be updated and that everyone would need to take something like a booster shot to combat newer variant?
Hi. People might downvote me but I want to ask about an online option. I have my own health struggles and I do not feel safe returning to campus in the fall. The thought of it gives me great anxiety. I understand that I could take a gap year, but I really don’t want to take time off of working on my degree. Do you think the university will offer an online option? Thank you.
Hi professor, could you do climate catastrophe and impact analysis type of post? Seeing the light at the end of the covid tunnel is phenomenal, however it seems like our futures as undergrads are in for a wild ride.

Edit: to all downvotes, sorry for trying to learn. There’s a lot of fear mongering garbage out there and I figured maybe nick would know something helpful.
Production of new vaccine is on the order of ~1-2 million doses per day, so supply constraints should ease up soon.
Nice! Do you think that the summer semester will still be online, or do you think its possible it could switch to in-person?
woohoo! q: when you refer to selection pressures in this context, are you referring to increasing immunity leading to strains with lower contagiousness becoming relatively less prevalent?
[deleted]
I think we’d have to wear a mask even if it’s not out of politeness since the Pfizer vaccine is 95% effective. We would expect that it is still possible although unlikely that people can get Covid
You can still get sick and have long term effects from ~~the vaccine~~ covid though, from what I hear. Trying to find the source I read on this but the thing I fear most is damaging my lungs as someone young.

EDIT: brainfarted, meant to say long term effects from COVID
WOOOOO
Thanks for the update Nick! Do you think future summer semesters will have online options? Hoping that’s the case, since that would allow students to work/intern in places outside of Berkeley while taking classes.
Do you think in a year we will have in person graduation? Thanks for the update
My algorithm for that is if I can book through a site on day 1, I won't book, but see if its still there day 2.  If so, sign me up...
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/21/opinion/covid-vaccine-ethics.html
I believe moderate, Coronaviruses do mutate a fair bit less than Influenza but they do mutate, and COVID-19 is now endemic worldwide.
I somewhat doubt it.  Certain things, especially office hours, has been a disaster in the online format.
In total, the J&J, Pfizer, and Moderna trials have involved hundreds of thousands of people (50% placebo, 50% vaccine). Every single person who died was in the placebo group. *Every single one*. Out of hundreds of thousands. The trials have included elderly people, chronically ill people, people who are immunosuppressed - every group you can imagine. And nobody who got the vaccine died.

There's just no reason not to bring a vaccinated campus back in person in the fall. The vaccines are so, so good.

I know that the idea of existing on campus in person again feels pretty scary right now, but I think that as things normalize over the summer, it's going to feel much less crazy. We have what is essentially a miracle tool to end this pandemic, and we just have to use it. I suffer from plenty of anxiety myself, and I know that anxiety isn't rational (as much as it tries to convince you that it is!), but the world also has to operate on practicalities, and sometimes that means ripping the band-aid off and telling our anxiety to get fucked.
Reddit. The place where you can get downvoted for worrying about your personal health.
Its depressing and lets leave it at that for now.
If I am not mistaken that is world wide. While US can secure a good fraction, that is not as good as it sounds. Also even if the US gets ≈2 million vaccines per day, with 2 doses, it will still take nearly a year for the general population to get vaccinated.
It should Remain online as many people do not have housing options for this summer and have not planned to be required to return to campus this summer.
They already committed to summer being online.  It wouldn't surprise me if Summer stays online even in the After Times, because it can actually increase enrollment.
I heard it was online. This probably makes sense for logistical reasons though I am expecting a normal summer. Planned events are more realistic for the fall.
Speaking for international students, summer semesters have either been cancelled and the few that are running are online only
We don't need herd immunity to allow life to go back to normal. Herd immunity isn't the endgame; prevention of severe disease in the elderly and high-risk populations is the endgame.
according to the data from israel, the vaccine is 98.9% effective against death and serious illness. we didn't wear masks for the flu or the common cold (although people who are actively sick probably should), not sure why we'd do it for 99%-nerfed covid.
I will not be taking my mask off anytime soon.
The vaccines will make you feel bad for a day or two as your immune system ramps up.  There really is no real mechanism for long-term effects as especially the mRNA vaccines are non-replicating and the immune system target (the Spike protein) is not even close to anything your body normally produces.

How they work is they trick your muscle cells into producing the spike protein and then your immune system goes to town.  This XKCD cartoon is a remarkably accurate description of how it works:

https://xkcd.com/2425/

And the results of the vaccines are amazing.  95% effectiveness at getting sick from COVID at all and, remarkably, effectively 100% at preventing death if you still get infected.  NOBODY in the vaccine groups for the J&J, Pfizer, or Moderna vaccines died during the clinical trial, but a significant number in the control groups did.

They were worse in-person. Especially with 61c and 162. You should know that.

I don’t think it would kill the university to offer an online option for one more semester this fall. People who want to return would still be welcome to.
[deleted]
Thank you for your response.
He is not a professor, he is a lecturer. He is not a qualified expert on the topic of COVID-19 and even the area he is a “qualified” expert on is questionable: he overworks students in CS 61C with their project 1 had a median around 50% while the professor the semester before had a median of a 100%. Students understood C with other professors and write working code. I guarantee his student will walk away with lower grades and less understanding due to it being wasted on tedious projects and trying to decipher his lectures which include more of his opinions and pets than actual explanations of content. In fact, going through 10 slides every minute without explaining doesn’t count as teaching in my book and is disgrace to other professors. However there are bad lecturers with valid opinions but it is important to listen to experts in the field.

His word is not representative of the university and I would not take his word on many subjects here. I expect a virtual option for those in need of it such as those in other countries without a vaccine and medical conditions. Him holding OH after he is being vaccinated using his paycheck shows his carelessness and is unfair to all the international students who can’t attend them in-person.

It is disheartening to see Berkeley students in the comments react to this message without thinking for themselves and follow the hive mind of Reddit, please downvote me to prove me correct! Below me another redditor is downvoted for saying that people should still wear masks even after they get the vaccine for the first few weeks in-person and people respond saying they will wear a mask if people cough. They lack understanding that masks protect others not yourself as it is possible for you to carry the virus while being vaccinated. Fiat Lux.
Production has been around 2M doses per day (to the US) recently, but in March should go up to around 4M doses per day delivered to the US. Worldwide it is a lot more than that.
What about libraries?
From now on, if I'm in a room with 800 students and one of them starts coughing I'll put on my own mask.
You have no idea how happy I am to see people being reasonable about coronavirus on r/berkeley.
I’m using data from the CDC:

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html#:~:text=Information%20on%20how%20well%20the%20vaccine%20works

I would wear a mask even if people aren’t coughing if you’re around a lot of them anyway. 

In an interview with Stephen Colbert, CNNs chief medical correspondent Dr Sanjay Gupta mentioned that we would still have to wear a mask despite having the vaccine: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DM6Askru5LI

Whether this is “fake news” or not I’m not going to posit, but I am not willing to take the risk either way
This attitude is what led to covid happening. I never expected to see arguing about wearing masks in r/Berkeley where I expected most people to be above average intelligence.
Er, sorry- misworded that. From what I've heard, you can still get long term effects from covid even after vaccinated, from what I've heard- I've got a buddy in the travel industry following all the covid news very closely, still trying to hunt down a source.

edit: one source https://www.theverge.com/22266344/covid-vaccine-protection-chronic-long-haul
Yes. The issue is that covid has some rather scary long term symptoms.
For the scalable CS classes we really rely on office hours and especially the in-person where students end up helping other students while waiting for the TA.  We’ve tried to replicate it as much as possible but overall it is vastly inferior to in-person for the large CS classes.
I'll concur on this, Office Hours have been a lot more helpful for me these past few semesters. I usually take upper-div Mech classes, but being able to share my code with a GSI and having them mark down my hilarious errors has been very useful.
They have been worse than terrible, 3+ hour waits are not uncommon.
Last fall I had the worst experiences with office hours in my life (up to 12 hour waits), and I honestly think that it would have been way better if it were in person because students could have at least helped each other out while waiting for help. (This was 61C with over 1,000 students)
Almost everyone can. It’s been approved for pregnant people, immunocompromised people, cancer patients, basically anyone who’s 16+ and hasn’t had a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine in the past. (And even then, especially with the J&J vaccine getting approval within a few days, doctors are able to figure out which ingredient you’re allergic to and pick a vaccine without it.) It’s free with or without insurance, it’s available to a large segment of campus *now* by virtue of campus jobs and work-study, and, most of all, it’s extremely safe and tested across every segment of the population in many countries.

There’s just not a lot of room for excuses.
1)  I never claim to be a professor, nor to speak for the University.  Do you know what the difference is between lecturer and professor?  A professor is paid to manage a million dollar a year research group and do a little teaching on the side.  I'd rather be teaching than managing a research group.

2)  In person office hours is hardly careless:  Firstly, it is in addition to my Tuesday/Thursday zoom office hours.  Second it will certainly be out doors per current university policy.

And finally I can read an actuarial chart:  For my students the risks from COVID are mild, there is a strong function of age vs risk, which has been clear from the beginning.  Given the fatality of COVID vs the fatality rate the fraternities occur from alcohol & parties the risk of death for most students is roughly the same as joining a fraternity (at least in the same ballpark)

UC needs to be serious about COVID in the student population because, a, the University leadership is conservative to the point of paranoia on anything that may potentially result in a lawsuit and, b, it is critical that students don't act as a reserve of infection for the larger university population and community.

3)  Project 1 in 61C is actually remarkably short these days: ~100 lines of code and change for a 100% solution.  What makes it hard is that it touches on a huge amount of the C language (which is remarkably alien and hostile for students used to Java and Python) and critically we don't provide the autograder as a black-box tester.  The latter is something that I think 61A and B do wrong because it means students don't spend nearly enough time thinking of how to test their code.  Oh, and the median is significantly higher, especially when you exclude those who dropped the class.

4)  I may not be an epidemiologist but my early research is on the computer equivalent.  Plus I actually have a moderate MCB background, as that was my out of department minor.

5)  On post vaccination masks, please see Zeynep Tufekci:  https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1359328328264658949  This is once again bad messaging.  The ""we don't know"" on post vaccination transmission is a bad message, the real message is ""we don't know BUT the majority of the evidence and simple understanding of how this thing spreads suggests that post vaccination you are highly likely to not be able to spread"", because in order to spread it you either have to be symptomatic OR have a infection that evades your immune system but doesn't produce symptoms.

And although presymptomatic/asymptomatic spread is why COVID-19 has spread so much more than SARS (you can't catch it with temperature screens), symptomatic people do spread it significantly more effectively.  So that alone suggests that widespread vaccination will significantly reduce the spread, not just the bad outcomes.

6)  A remote option university wide won't happen.  Why?  Because a lot of the lecture space is simply not set up for good recording, especially for all the <100 person upper division classes.  And faculty aren't going to want to teach those classes twice, one for in person and once for a remote fraction.
Someone should not be in class if they’re coughing for the next year or two. I’ll kick them out personally.
I think that's just advice they're giving to be extra safe because there isn't conclusive research yet showing the vaccine prevents spread. It almost certainly does though, and once vaccination is widespread spread won't matter much anyways.

You do you, but once everyone who wants the vaccine has been vaccinated I'll go back to normal life.

at least you can still get help, ik many people who told me they often couldnt get help at all in-person
The other person call you professor, I was respond to them. Also new flash: the university doesn’t care about what’s easier for lecturers and they did do online learning as show by this semester. I also have word from administrators through personal connections that say it will have virtual remote option in the fall. This makes sense for those not in CA and with conditions. The university can also accept more students in a sustainable manner this way for housing as well, so your opinion is widely unsubstantiated to be fully in-person. And that is the only new information you say since Carol Christ email say we will be have in-person in Fall before this post was made. This post seems nothing like a flex that you got vaccine and that you are holding OH. With unsubstantiated claims from what I heard personally from people involved with campus more.
Or they should at the very least be wearing a mask
Yeah the risk is we might be vaccinated thanks to the university but the general population of Berkeley might not and with the campus being in such close proximity with the city it’s a risk nevertheless
How are you hurt by wearing masks?
I mean, yeah, but also the individual likelihood of most people catching covid within their lifetimes is very, very high at this point lol. So it's still something to be wary of. I'm still going to get the vaccine of course, but it's just something to keep in mind.
For smaller classes we colud do hybrid: have both in person AND an open Zoom window.
For graduation requirement classes, I'd say 60-100 (i.e. ME109 or ME106), so not too different from the mid-level classes like Statics.

For upper-div tech electives, they range from 20ish (More specialized classes like MEC180 - Finite Element Analysis) to 70ish (for more wide-ranging classes like ME163 - Aerodynamics).
but you could cooperate with the other students there in the meantime, which was far more helpful than waiting in a zoom room.
aside from student employees, cal students don't get any special priority for the vaccine. in fact most of the student body will be in the lowest priority group for vaccinations. so by the time most students are vaccinated, any older at-risk adult who wants the vaccine will have gotten it.
You're trolling, right? Do you think people will wear masks for the rest of their lives even after covid is long gone in like 2030?
[deleted]
You can’t share code for many classes without bordering on cheating. Having a TA look at your commented code can be very helpful in project classes.

I have been forced to leave OH before due to students cheating and me not wanting to be involved.
I never said that? Nice strawman but the reluctance here to wear masks for the first few weeks we go in-person will lead to COVID-21.
This phenomenon of some people insisting upon continued mask wearing even after enough people are vaccinated to blunt the impact of the disease to something around flu levels is very strange. Lots of well-intentioned people who inadvertently or not have stumbled upon the position of wanting to totally rewrite the rules of society in the name of ""health.""
No, we're talking about the same thing, I'm just clarifying since somebody seems to be downvoting me for my viewpoints lmao. Long haul symptoms aren't new, I'm just particularly spooked by rona ones since I like my lungs and I like playing sports and stuff.
[deleted]
[deleted]
Yes. That is my point.
Ah, that's where the confusion was. Til, thanks for the clarification
Incorrect.

"" Early clinical studies have shown that **COVID** patients may experience complications like myocarditis (inflammation of the **heart**), abnormal **heart** rhythms and other cardiac sequelae weeks after contracting the virus""

[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-problem-of-long-haul-covid/#:\~:text=Early%20clinical%20studies%20have%20shown,weeks%20after%20contracting%20the%20virus](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-problem-of-long-haul-covid/#:~:text=Early%20clinical%20studies%20have%20shown,weeks%20after%20contracting%20the%20virus).

""What has emerged from this self-reporting is the clear realization that long COVID is very real, that the chronic health manifestations can be quite debilitating, that the syndrome may affect a significant number of individuals, and that much more research and care provision are urgently needed.

“From my perspective, it appears that post-COVID symptoms tend to be more common, severe, and longer-lasting than other viral illnesses, such as influenza,” says Timothy Hendrich, a viral immunologist and infectious disease expert at University of California, San Francisco.""
 **How does COVID-19 affect the heart?**

Viruses attack the body by infecting cells directly. In the case of COVID-19, the virus primarily attacks the lungs. However, it can also cause your body to produce an overactive immune response which can lead to increased inflammation throughout the body.

Myocarditis can impair the heart’s ability to pump blood and send electrical signals. Severe forms of myocarditis can lead to more serious problems like abnormal heart rhythms, heart muscle disease and heart failure.

According to one study out of the University of Frankford in Germany, more than half of patients studied who had COVID-19 were found to have ongoing cardiac inflammation. Researchers noted that more than two-thirds of the patients who participated in the study had a mild illness and recovered at home from COVID-19.

**“The concern now is that even with a mild case of COVID-19, there’s a possibility that there could be inflammation and damage to your heart,” says Dr. Sharma.**

However, it’s important to know that the abnormalities seen in the study can happen with other viral infections and may be temporary. Many cases of mild heart inflammation may not show symptoms and get better on their own.

**COVID-19 symptoms can sometimes persist for months. The virus can damage the lungs, heart and brain, which increases the risk of long-term health problems.**

[https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351)  


Organ damage caused by COVID-19

Although COVID-19 is seen as a disease that primarily affects the lungs, it can damage many other organs as well. This organ damage may increase the risk of long-term health problems. Organs that may be affected by COVID-19 include:

* **Heart.** Imaging tests taken months after recovery from COVID-19 have shown lasting damage to the heart muscle, even in people who experienced only mild COVID-19 symptoms. This may increase the risk of heart failure or other heart complications in the future.
* **Lungs.** The type of pneumonia often associated with COVID-19 can cause long-standing damage to the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. The resulting scar tissue can lead to long-term breathing problems.
* **Brain.** Even in young people, COVID-19 can cause strokes, seizures and Guillain-Barre syndrome — a condition that causes temporary paralysis. COVID-19 may also increase the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.

### Blood clots and blood vessel problems

COVID-19 can make blood cells more likely to clump up and form clots. While large clots can cause heart attacks and strokes, much of the heart damage caused by COVID-19 is believed to stem from very small clots that block tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the heart muscle.

Other parts of the body affected by blood clots include the lungs, legs, liver and kidneys. COVID-19 can also weaken blood vessels and cause them to leak, which contributes to potentially long-lasting problems with the liver and kidneys.

"I'm currently a high school senior that got into Cal with a Electrical Engineering/Computer Science major. How soon can I change my major, and how easy is it for me to do so?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bhk2c/im_currently_a_high_school_senior_that_got_into/,2013-04-01 19:17:47,"Basically, I applied as a ElecEng/CompSci major because I wasn't quite sure what to apply as, and it would be better than applying undecided. But now I'm sure that I want to major in linguistics, so I'm hoping for a major change.

Is there any information on their website or elsewhere that I could reference? I found [this page](http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/major/change.html), but I'm not sure what the College of Letters and Sciences is.","You want to change from EECS to Linguistics?

*wat*

April...*Fools?*
Switching between these two majors involves a change of college. The EECS major is in the college of engineering, while linguistics is in the college of letters and science. Berkeley and its majors are broken up into different colleges (engineering, letters and science, chemistry, natural resources, etc).

Letters and science is like the artsci college, and is by far the largest college on campus. Each college has different ""college requirements"" that you must complete on top of the requirements for your specific major. For the sake of comparison, [here](http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/requirements) are the college requirements for CoE, and [here](http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/requirement/summary.html) are the college requirements for L&S.

As far as I know, switching from CoE to L&S is much easier than the other way around. [Here](http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/registration/changeofcollege.html) is the page regarding switching into L&S. It looks like you'll simply need to fill out a form and submit it to the undergraduate advising. You don't need to worry about switching colleges before you get to Berkeley--since it seems like it's the same procedure for anyone who has under 60 units (class credits).

Just select your classes for the fall 2013 semester in accordance to your linguistics major, and deal with the change of college/major after you arrive here.

Remember if you need more help, then you can talk to the undergraduate advising, on the second floor of evans hall once you get here.

Congrats on your admission and go bears!
Did you see the list of C&L majors on the right side?
EECS is in the College of Engineering (CoE), which is much harder to get into than the College of Letters and Science (L&S -the ""main"" college where most of the majors are). 
It's much easier to transfer from CoE to L&S, but it would be very difficult to go the other way. 

CoE I believe is actually the only college to require you to declare (and hopefully stick to) an intended major when you're first admitted. 
In any other scenario, you would officially be undeclared anyway and switching majors isn't an issue until you officially declare your sophomore/junior year, but not with CoE. 

Since I'm not in CoE I'm not totally sure what the process is, but I hope this information helps somewhat. 
Try a Google search? :/ 
Why not do both and then come up with a way better version of Siri :-)
...no, I'm being serious :(
Oh yeah--and as letrainfalldown said, you will most likely switch into L&S undeclared (with no major). L&S majors will not let you declare until you've completed some preliminary requirements. 

For linguistics, it looks like you just need to finish LING 100 before you are allowed to apply ([here](http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/apply.php)).

After finishing up that requirement, you will be able to switch your major from undeclared to Lingusitics.
So in short, treat everything normally and once the school year starts, file a change of major.
Yes, I'm taking a look at that right now but I can't really find anything very useful.
Good on you! Linguistics is rad and Berkeley has one of the top programs. Are you interested in computational linguistics? A minor in CS could work out very well for you.
Cool, thanks.
Yeah, just choose your classes in the direction of your linguistics major and then switch colleges your first semester here. Maybe declare your major the semester after that or in your second year.

Hope that helped (:
It helped a lot - thanks!"
Nick Weaver's Post COVID Teaching Policy,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ma3ps0/nick_weavers_post_covid_teaching_policy/,2021-03-21 12:13:01,"The University has announced that Fall is mostly in-person with only large classes (>200 students) offering a remote option.  I personally think this is even a little conservative (see why below at [1]) but it is understandable.  So these are my plans for both the end of the Spring semester and teaching for the Fall semester.

To start with, I hope to hold in person office hours on Wednesdays starting after Spring Break, because at that point I’ll be “quasi-vaccinated”, as I’m scheduled to get my second dose on that Wednesday.  I am still waiting on having cardkey access to Soda to confirm but things are hopeful.  Worst case it won’t happen until the week after or so, I haven’t yet gotten confirmation on my cardkey working.

This will be according to Berkeley’s current protocol (outdoor, masks, and participation in the COVID screening) but I’m hoping that Berkeley will soon extend the in-person guidelines in line with CDC guidance for fully vaccinated individuals.  If so, that means I could see students inside my office since two weeks after that I will be in the “fully vaccinated” category.

As for the fall we already know that a lot of students don’t actually attend lectures, instead preferring webcasts.  So I will give live lectures and webcast/record for those who want remote access, which is the general protocol I’ve always used.  Most discussions/labs will be in-person as well, but there will be an online option.

The most interesting problem with this mixed model for large classes is exams.  In-person proctoring is clearly easier, more effective, and lower stress for the students.  Not that much lower, mind you, because both CS161 developed a relatively low stress proctoring method and we are still talking about midterms from someone with a reputation for “hard exams but easy curve”.

But we will need to support some remote proctoring.  I expect to use a tool that produces the same exam for both (e.g. the 61A examtool or how the 161 exams are generated and derandomized) and will strongly encourage in-person exams.  It may even be the case that there may be in-person exams where the students bring their own laptops if we have access to exam rooms with suitably numerous power ports so it is an “in-person on-line exam”.

We are also continuing to work on remote proctoring.  For example, one idea that we’ve had for “closed net” exams is that we could use the exam’s site as the proctoring camera/microphone.  This should enable light-touch 161-style remote proctoring without needing a separate setup.

With the right additional policies (e.g. TAs only have a live view of the students and the only recordings occur if something suspicious occurs) this should allow us to do remote proctoring with easier setup and reasonable privacy concerns but without increasing the stress level for the students.  The instructions would be simple: open the exam, say “Yes” when it wants to access the camera and microphone, and just stay on the exam web page while you work.

So overall things are looking up.  Going forward I intend to keep the things that worked (e.g. chat as a mechanism for asking questions, remote proctoring to enable scalable low-distraction environment proctoring for DSP students, etc) and ditch things that didn’t (e.g. ONLY on-line office hours in programming classes).  And I hope to see lots of you in person in the fall.

.

[1] Why do I think this is conservative?  Because the vaccines are miraculously good.  Fully vaccinated individuals (2 weeks after second dose for Pfizer or Moderna, 2 weeks after single dose for Johnson and Johnson) have incredible protection: 75-95% effectiveness and preventing infection altogether, and effectively 100% effective at turning COVID-19 from a serious disease to yet another common cold coronavirus.  

The US, despite having done our damndest to be pro-virus in the spreading phase, is doing amazingly well on vaccination: ~25% of the entire population is already at one dose, and we are vaccinating at the rate of nearly 2.5 million a day.  12% of California is already fully vaccinated and the rate of vaccination is continuing to climb.  Treating July 4th as “normal” is almost a certainty at this point.

And variants don’t worry me too much in the face of vaccination.  If we think of the virus as an attacker there is a bind it is in.  The spike protein is a “key” that has to match to specific proteins on our cell for the virus to get in.  But it is also the target that vaccines train our body to recognize.  So mutations that reduce the immune response are likely to also reduce infectiousness.

More importantly even a partially effective vaccination will probably still prevent bad outcomes.  The growth of a virus in your body is an exponential process.  And although exponentials can cause things to grow very scary very fast, they are actually remarkably slow to start and incredibly sensitive to initial conditions.  Even a fairly weak initial immune response will result in a substantial improvement in outcomes.  It appears that previous coronaviruses have followed this trajectory.  Combine this with a booster in the fall a’la the flu vaccine and SARS-CoV-2 becomes yet another common cold coronavirus.

Good riddance","[deleted]
I think the one thing I would like to ask Nick is how room scheduling is going to work for exams and discussions...many professors and instructors have said it takes months in advance to schedule rooms for midterms and discussion section...so how are things going to work out in the fall if 1) a large number of people plan on staying at home, 2) exam times and dates need to be provided in advance, and 3) professors will allow laptops on the exam rooms (space may be an issue)
I think although some of us got vaccines, most haven’t, and spring break with everyone everywhere it might pose a problem. But omg will you be hosting in person office hours after spring break? Can I go even if I don’t take your class? :D
Thank you for sharing your plans, I’m excited for 61C in the fall!
What are your thoughts on the new 66% effective 1-dose J&J vaccine? Will people who took that vaccine likely to need a second dose, or switch to the 95% effective Pfizer/Moderna? If you got J&J instead of Moderna/Pfizer, would you feel comfortable attending large gatherings again?

I hear the vaccine is very popular because it's the only 1-dose vaccine available in the US. How would this affect the vaccination timeline since the 80% heard immunity threshold was assuming everyone get the 95% effective Pfizer/Moderna?
Thank you for your post Nick. I hope all of our classes offer online support (for exams and OH) for the fall because I think many of us, including myself, just don’t feel safe coming back to Berkeley. Not just because of the virus, but crime rate has been climbing itself and there is very little to do in city now that many places have been closed. Plus, finding housing now is going to cost many of us too much time and stress.
i miss ya professor :)
If the numbers are low enough, do you think Berkeley will walk back the <200 lecture restriction and allow all lectures to be in-person?
I plan to take your 61c class this fall. I saw that the lecture component will be online. Does that mean that we will use Zoom to join live lectures?
That would be why: with in-person the proctoring becomes much easier.
Idk tbh I really do not want to take another exam on Gradescope or exam tool. Maybe it’s just me but I just don’t enjoy the majority of my grade on a few multiple choice/select and short answer questions. 

Also I still much rather fill in bubbles on a sheet of paper than click buttons online.
Weeks, actually, not months.  And I expect most students won't be remote since the default assumption is for <200 person classes to be in-person only.
Sure.
Oh You Poor, Sweet, Innocent Child.
It is 66% effective at preventing infection, BUT this was in a world where there were many more variants, so the actual protection may be the same as Pfizer/Moderna.

And critically it is still almost 100% effective at turning SARS-CoV-2 into Yet Another Common Cold Coronavirus, which is what really counts.
Fortunately there is time on housing.  But I suspect most students will come back in person, since the default for <200 person classes is going to be in person.

I suspect for my office hours I'll still have a Zoom window open, and we will probably have some zoom-supporting O/H, but in person was just so much more efficient at solving student problems in 61C and 161 that the primary default is going to be in person.
Well, for CS it doesn't matter: recording is sufficient to allow the remote folks to be remote and the in-person be in-person.
[deleted]
[deleted]
🥺 he bout to be shafted.
You're implying that there will be less variants in the future? Why is this the case? J&J is only 50-60% effective against the newer African strain, isn't this a major worry still remaining? 

My doctor said the point is to get everyone vaccinated ASAP regardless of 66% vs 95% effectiveness because we want to prevent the virus from mutating so fast it makes current vaccines obsolete. But so long as low income countries are lagging behind in vaccine access, the virus could still mutate abroad and make J&J and even Pfizer and Moderna obsolete. Wouldn't this still be a major worry even if the US reached herd immunity?
Are 61C and 161 <200 person classes? I am confused to how “the primary default is going to be in person” for those classes…
I actually prefer remote exams over in person exams at least for CS exams since there’s less distractions (people coughing, entering/exiting rooms) but I also recognize that some people can’t take remote exams in a quiet setting
Not all CS classes are > 200 ppl
For the first thing, I think he was referencing how the Johnson and Johnson was tested at a later time, in which there were more variants, so it might not be that much different than Pfizer/moderna(j and j played against a harder team, we gotta cut it some slack if Pfizer/moderna wrecked an easier team). 
As for the second question, that’s a good point, idk, maybe someone else knows more.
No lol.
The discussions and labs will default to in person.  Lecture will be webcast, and there will be accomodations for remote.  We have been told that discussions, since they are <200 each, default to in-person even if the lecture is supporting remote.
In-person discussions sound like we can finally go back to normal, thanks for keeping us in the know!"
Moffit rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/aqg1xx/moffit_rant/,2019-02-13 20:49:41,"Am I being too sensitive or is a library an inappropriate place to have a meal? I'm not talking about snacks or a salad or like a pb\&j; I mean a huge ass smelly ass carne asada burrito or a dirty ass plate of chipotle. I know I have anxiety and I'm sensitive to certain things but eating a smelly fat ass meal at a table with your head phones on chewing with your mouth open sounding so putrid but you can't even hear it yourself drives me fucking insane.

But honestly, am I being too sensitive? Just the idea of eating a meal and then studying in the same spot makes me cringe. But besides that, isn't that rude or disrespectful to others around you? Is my anger justified or am I just a bitch. It just seems like common sense to me to go down to the cafe or outside to have a meal. Not in a room with barely any ventilation. How can you even enjoy chewing your food when it's so quiet and everyone can hear every bite you take... And it's not like I can just get up and go move somewhere else when every single seat in the library is taken.

I'm not trolling, I really want to know if this is a popular opinion or if I'm just a ball of anxiety. Btw good luck on midterms. I'd be studying but I'm losing my shit rn with this kid eating his smelly ass burrito next me while watching netflix.

EDIT: I'm on the 5th floor. Kid finished burrito after 30 fucking minutes. Girl just showed up with takeout, chow mien and orange chicken, my favorite ...

EDIT2: I realize that my expectation of Moffit 5th floor were unreasonable and I'll be studying somewhere where food isn't allowed. I also realized that most responses were really dick and the sample size I'm surveying is literally the dude eating the burrito while he's skimming reddit. I made it clear at the beginning of the post that I'm aware that specific things trigger my anxiety and I overall didn't appreciate how insensitive people were in their responses with respect to my mental health. Anyways, eating your burrito while your on a walk around the glade is better for your health but that's none of my business.","I think the point of Moffitt 4th floor was so people could make noise + eat, etc etc. Sorry if this was 5th floor though since it's supposed to be quiet.

If you want quiet + more available seating, check out Main Stacks/Doe.
Moffitt is the only library where you can eat. If you don't want to hear it, go to Stacks or Doe or the East Asian Library or another one of the dozens of libraries on campus. If you're annoyed by something that's completely allowed in Moffitt, get up and leave or ask them to move instead of trying to garner support from a bunch of anonymous Redditors.
In my opinion, I don’t think it’s rude unless he’s on the quiet floor or chewing very loudly. I feel moffit was made and designed to create a comfortable, laid back atmosphere where you can study with  friends, talk, and eat. If this occurred in main stack, or in the quiet floor, I would think it’s rude since it’s in an extremely quiet, studious environment where people go to escape the distractions of the outside world 
Sorry about that.  On the flipside, you can consider it a free live ASMR eating session.  Perhaps if you view it this way it can be relaxing instead of anxiety-inducing.
“There aren’t any other seats” - this line here is exactly why they aren’t taking their meal elsewhere. Are they supposed to give up their seat so that you don’t feel anxious? In my opinion, while a mild nuisance, I think you’re overreacting. Like others have suggested if you want dead silence then relocate to main stacks
I personally hate it too, but that's EXACTLY why I don't ever go to Moffit unless it's the only place open on campus (and even then, I would try to go to my lab or some other building I have access to on campus unless it's too far). 

I highly recommend just moving to Main Stacks, tbh. It's such a nice place to focus. People think it's depressing but I personally think it's very liberating. 
If you don’t like it, gtfo. There are plenty of study spaces besides moffitt that don’t allow eating. 
shout out to the dude loudly slurping soup next to me with his airpods in 
lol salads can be smelly and messy too, in fact, because of the dressing they usually do have a fairly intense smell. do u actually have a problem with eating in the library in general or do u just have a problem with certain foods that you personally think are gross, specifically mexican food for some reason???

Also, because of all the rain and FSM being too packed to sit down, people need an indoor place to eat in between classes. Sometimes people literally have to eat in the library. While it may be ""better for you"" to eat while walking around the glade, its currently very rainy and that isn't an option. Furthermore, even if it wasn't raining, who are you to say what's better for anyone else? As someone with anxiety myself, I think its incredibly unfortunate that you use yours as a guise to sit in the library and judge and shit talk people on the internet for doing something you're literally allowed to do (eat in library). Apparently healthy, glade-walking, library salad-eaters are fine but not gross burrito eaters? lol why. thats such a strange and judgmental line to draw.

In conclusion, I think its easily way more rude to the people around you to be throwing judgement at them than it is to be eating in a place where you're allowed to eat.
I think you may just be crazy. 
It makes me anxious too. I have had precisely one experience with Moffitt as a study space. I went to the 5th floor to catch up on some homework and the second I sat down the person right next to me opened up a bag of kettle-cooked chips and starting eating them with her mouth open. I guess the moral is that not everybody is suited to the same study environments. On the bright side, you will/have probably find/found VLSB and/or Main Stacks more to your liking and style of studying. Although let's be real, Moffitt being the only library where eating is allowed doesn't mean it's the only library where eating occurs. Many an eyeroll has been given to people who sneak boba into Main Stacks.
I understand your frustration, but I think you need to learn how to chill a bit. Don't grow up to be grumpy and irritable. For me, I don't have a problem with it as I understand its a public place and students get hungry sometimes. 

Funny story, I had a girl flip out on me for bringing a pb&j to the Moffitt library. I was like wtf? It literally has no smell and I'm eating with my mouth closed so that there's no noise.
Your real problem is trying to study near strangers. People in general are disgusting and repulsive, and must be thoroughly vetted before you get near them. I don’t know how anyone can get anything done in Moffitt.
[deleted]
It bothers the shit out of me but I always feel like an asshole for feeling that way too. I really don'y want to smell your nasty food in the morning though
What irritates me about Moffitt is when people literally take up spots at the computers without even using them. Half of time people are simply watching Youtube videos on their laptops. There have been several instances where I ask people if I could use a computer that they have taken up only to be told that they will be using it despite the fact that they are on their laptops looking at memes for more than 10 minutes...
[deleted]
>Am I being too sensitive or is a library an inappropriate place to have a meal?

No, you are not being too sensitive. Libraries are for studying. Have dinner somewhere else. Hell, have your snacks standing in some hallway away from other people. The getting-up / not-sitting-still-for-hours-on-end will do you good anyway.

\^ The ""your"" and ""you"" are with reference to people in general.
I agree with you! People should try to be more considerate. Also it sucks there are so many rude comments here :( 
And East Asian, VLSB library, and pretty much every other library on campus where eating isn't allowed
i think moffit is perfect. It allows people to casually study.
I understand that but did you read through my post? I’m not trying to garner support, I’m literally asking people to prove my opinion wrong. Holy shit you and somma are real pieces of work. 
I do love myself a free ASMR session.
Ahhh the ~*tingles*~
I can get ASMR free on youtube anyways, why does it have to be smelly
Yeah I realize I'm overreacting but they can take their meals outside then come back in when they finish
I mean there’s also the other floors in moffit where you can’t eat.
Forreal, all these people saying sorry about it when OP could easily go to literally any of the other libraries on campus that don’t allow eating 
That's mildly offensive. Being anxious about minor specific things doesn't make me crazy.
Finally, someone who understands me 
A777777aaaa
Thanks mate. Yeah I couldn't function without my bose qc35's. Like you said, I realized that I need to be more mindful of my triggers. I'm trying out east asian this weekend which should be better
Ahaha no you're not. Don't even pretend. You're looking for people to agree with you. We're not stupid, dude. 
Extra senses - extra realism
Lmao how is this so downvoted. People are weird.
And then have someone write a post complaining about how people leave their stuff to save seats or have their stuff stolen? Moffit is basically a student centric MLK
Alright cool that makes sense, there are other places I can study so I'll study somewhere else. However, that's still gross as fuck eating your food on the same desk that someone just sneezed on.
In my opinion, most people would think think it's irrational, if not crazy, to get angry over the fact that people are eating in a place where eating is specifically allowed.
You’re not crazy, you’re just being unreasonable. As others have said, there are plenty of other “serious study spaces”. It’s nice to have both 
My post literally says “But honestly am I being too sensitive?”, how much more straightforward do I have to be? 
Ask someone to watch your stuff... You can communicate right? If your gone for hours at a time it will probably get stolen, but not for a 20 min lunch break while someone is watching your belongings.
Well, sure, if you want to think of it that way. But that applies to literally all public tables, so you'd have a problem with eating anywhere but in your home. That's okay, but note that most people are okay with eating on public areas. This is why you usually have a ""container"" around your food.

Moffit 4th floor was designed to be able to eat food. It's one of the main features. 
Probably just a thing that doesn't bother a lot of people.  I've never cared if people were eating around me while I'm trying to work, and so I wouldn't really assume other people were this perturbed by it.
You're right that makes sense, I know I'm irritable. 
Trust a stranger to watch valuable stuff so that the random reddit stranger won’t get upset? Dawg take everyone’s advice and move to a different library. People don’t need to accommodate you nor behave in the way you deem acceptable. Everyone that is saying “I understand omg you’re so valid and so are your feelings” are doing you a disservice. If something this trivial has this much of an effect on you 1) you have a problem and 2) you can easily remedy the situation by moving

Tl;dr your comfort doesn’t take priority over anyone else when they aren’t doing anything wrong 
My problem stems more from the fact that I like to eat in a specific place, study in a specific place, etc, and I'm just used to that... I'm on the 5th floor not the 4th.
Do you not think it's a bit ridiculous to expect everyone to conform to your personal arbitrary liking of being in Moffit when there's like twenty billion libraries in Berkeley in addition to places like Soda or Cory.

If I hated the sound of people drinking coffee but really liked to study in Starbucks, I really wouldn't have a case to be annoyed at the people drinking coffee in Starbucks.


but people like me like to have fried chicken in one hand and their Dijkstra’s Algorithm homework in the other
Sorry, but no one really cares about your preferences on where you eat, sleep, or study. You’re going to have lots of trouble when you leave Cal with a mindset like that. 
Yes, I do think it's unreasonable now. That was the purpose of my post, to see if my opinion was reasonable or not...
are you trolling or are you illiterate
You literally said that you like to do X, you like to do Y, so when someone else does something contrary to your preferences (aka eating in moffitt) you feel anxious. Sounds like you’re the one trolling, or maybe you just have something wrong with you that should be clinically checked out. 
Yeah I’m either trolling or I should get clinically checked out... Like those are the two options. Who the fuck do you think you are. I see my psych weekly and I make an effort to cope with my ocd as best I could.  Aside from my post, do you really think your in a position to start prescribing shit to strangers on the internet you know nothing about. 
Yeah I’m either trolling or I’m illiterate...Like those are the two options.

Jesus Christ you’re not just irritable but you’re just stupid. 
Name calling... nice, now I know the kind of person I’m talking to. It’s not cool to call people stupid over a keyboard. Even strangers on the internet have feelings believe it or not
Oh, so it’s okay to call someone illiterate but when I call you stupid it’s suddenly “not cool”? Fuck off. 
Damn your a hateful person. You’re going to have lots of trouble leaving Cal with a heart like that. Gl with midterms mate
Okay. You’re going to have lots of trouble leaving Cal being a hypocrite and all, but gl.
It’s something I’m working on. I don’t have to leave Cal a hypocrite if I make an effort to not be one. I hope you can do the same thing with your anger. 
I don’t know why you think me calling you out on your bullshit is me being angry. I’m not the one getting triggered by people eating in a space that allows for eating, nor am I getting my feelings hurt because someone on the internet wasn’t nice. I’m also not the one who doesn’t understand that if you say something “uncool”, you can’t get butthurt over when someone treats you the same way. Why would I get angry over you? Do you think you’re that special? Because you’re not. 
It’s okay I’ve been there, like I said, hopefully you’ll be less angry leaving Cal
😂 whatever you say dude. I’m not the one with issues. 
Must be nice"

I have acc no idea what to take this fall :( i took tons of cc classes so im done with all of my breadth requirements also. the biggest doozy, i am taking chem1a rn and eating ass. a lot of it is me not preparing well for mts and just cramming lectures/ content vs acc studying/prepping. and i don't know  (but i do know?) why this keeps happening, trust me i hate myself for it. anyways, this sem is probs the worst I've ever done academically and my self-esteem and mental health rn sucks. i did well first semester and this semester... its def not gonna be that great lmao. i am also premed which is stressful bc ppl ik b freakinnn about a B lmao. 

i was thinking about taking chem3a/3al this summer since i feel behind in the o-chem series already as i took chem1a in the spring and not fall. but now, idk whether i should just take chem3a/3al in fall (w robak). OR do just chem3a this summer and push lab to fall to not overwhelm myself over summer? i don't wanna wreck my gpa or my learning in such an important course. 

i cant even decide my fall classes bc it kinda depends on what i do over the summer. should i take some chill class to boost my gpa a little over summer, and also get the chance to self-study o-chem before i go into it? or should i j go for chem3a? i would get like 4+ weeks until that session starts to self prep.

i would really appreciate any help im sorry if this was all over the place, im so lost and my advising app is like right before fall enrollment lmao so i would love ur input <3","I haven’t taken 3a over the summer but hearing from people who did, it’s very intense. Mostly because organic chemistry is something you learn with practice, not just memorization. However taking it over the summer may be better for you if you’re not taking any other classes at the same time like you are this semester. Another thing is that it’s pretty hard to self-study for classes so unless you have all of Robaks notes to study over the summer, I doubt that it’ll be much help to try and prepare over the summer. Last thing, just because you’re not doing well in 1a doesn’t mean that 3a won’t go well for you. Maybe inorganic chemistry just isn’t your thing right now. In general I would say ask yourself if there’s any other classes you could take this summer that would be useful to you and your goals if you want to go a more relaxed route or be ready to really focus on 3a in the summer because you’ll need to take it one day.
""I'm a current freshman...i took tons of cc classes so im done with all of my breadth requirements""...what a legend
If Chem 3A is with Pete (marsden) I’d take over summer. He’s fantastic but don’t stress too much about being behind in 3 series. You can still take the bio 1A/1B and physics 8a/8b without needed the 3 series. The only thing is you need both bio 1A and Chem 3b to declare whenever you want to start taking upper divs
Hi! I am in the same situation, would it be better to take physics 8A during the summer than chem 3A, and then do physics after sophomore year (during that summer)?
hi there! i am totally unsure of who is teaching chem3a this summer. do you know if there is a way i can check this? tysm!!! also, would u recc taking chem3al simulatenously? :)
I believe if he is teaching 3B in the fall then he usually is teaching 3A in the summer. Also for labs it is up to you, they are needed to declare but it helps to take relatively close to when you took the class
Labs are not*** needed to declare"
Accepted to Berkeley L&S CS Vs. UCSD Computer Engineering. Any advice?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/b78h28/accepted_to_berkeley_ls_cs_vs_ucsd_computer/,2019-03-30 00:24:11,"As of now I'm literally not sure at all which school I'm leaning more towards and that's totally freaking me out. If you have any advice or a comment to share that would argue whether to attend/not attend Berkeley that'd be incredibly insightful, thank you!

Here is what I've thought of so far.

***Berkeley Pros:***

1.Prestige.

2.Quality of Professors.

3.Location.

4.Pretty Urban Environment (Esp compared to SD)

5.I'm a uber history nerd and Berkeley has had some dank history.

***Berkeley Cons:***

1.Wouldn't have a guarantee of becoming a CS major, and graduating in 4 years would be a struggle.

2.I've heard the culture is toxic/cut throat.

3.If I'm spending all my time worried about whether I'll even get my classes how will I be able to compete and get research opportunities, internships, co-ops.

4.Classes are huge and I thrive in environments where I'm allowed to ask 16 questions every 4 seconds.

5.Will I feel like I'm 'lower' than EECS students?

&#x200B;

***San Diego Pros:***

1.Far Away From Home. I know I'll grow more as a person the more independent I can be (I live in East San Fran Bay near)

2.Am in the College of Engineering so I've got the major that I want, and I can take MechEng and EE classes. I can get the CS classes I want.

3.Since SD is pretty good at getting everyone their courses and has a very structured 4 year course plan, I know I can graduate in 4 years and maybe at a 5th year there for a Masters.

4.Since I don't have to worry so much about all the classes I can explore what I want to do (Music, Sports, Engineering Clubs)

5.Class sizes are a bit smaller.

6.Far Away From Home. This is kinda important but also idk but also maybe but also idk help me i'm dying.

***San Diego Cons:***

1.The location is not Silicon Valley.

2.Its pretty much just a sub-urb.

3.Prestige isn't as high as berkeley.

&#x200B;

As I said before I'm really not sure what to choose. I've always dreamed of studying computer science and I know this sounds cliche but the whole concept of the Internet of Things, and using automation to do some really cool shit makes a lot of sense to me.","come to berkeley. it really sounds like berkeley is giving you a great opportunity which you will enjoy. berkeley cs also has a 5th year masters program in case you weren't aware. 

i'll say some stuff about the cons you listed to assuage some fears.

1. maybe elaborate on how graduating in 4 years is a struggle? most cs majors i know have the opportunity of graduating early (even some who switched into cs later in their undergrad careers)

2. cs culture is NOT cutthroat, despite the gpa cap and perceived curve. collaboration is encouraged and many students will find themselves in study groups make learning easier. much of the undergraduate population is taking some cs courses, so you're more than likely to find a good group of study buddies.

3. once declared you shouldnt worry too much about what cs classes you're getting. i've only had 1 instance where the course i wanted was full, and that's because i used my phase 1 on two other courses i wanted. (and it was a non-cs course at that)

4. most cs courses have something called piazza, which is a q&a forum where you can ask peers and staff about course questions. these are quite active and helpful. you wont necessarily be asking questions live during lecture, but you can post as much as you want to the dedicated forum. the one con is that it is hard to get to know professors from taking their class alone. 

5.  do not compare yourself to other students. there are people here with parents who have groomed them on a path to cs phds, along with those who have struggled make college an option. plus, it's better to be stupid with smart friends than to be smart with stupid friends. you'll learn more.
Berkeley Cons:

6. Quality of (CS) professors
Not OP but thanks so much for the insight. Def calmed some nerves. Go Bears!

Hard disagree.

I've taken/taking Data 8(Adhikari), 61A(Denero), 61BL(Summer TA's), 61C(Weaver), 70(Song/Sinclair), 100(Hug/Perez), 188(Russell/Levine) and all have been excellent instructors. I've had much better experiences with CS professors in general than many other departments. 

edit: oops i meant to reply to OP
The bad ones are plenty and bad enough to really disrupt one’s experience/education.
[deleted]
Yep. I had Denero but none of the others you had. Denero is on the complete opposite end of the CS professor spectrum at Cal (as is the course design for 61a) than Hilfinger, Sahai, etc... 

We can’t all cherry-pick the good professors and ones like Hilfinger and Sahai are fucking torture. There are also extreme differences between 61b course designs by professor which is bullshit. There should be a standardized curriculum.  "
