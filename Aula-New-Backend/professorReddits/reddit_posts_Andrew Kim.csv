"Bridges and QARC get $200k from the ASUC (= 22% funding to all clubs on campus) + $114,000 from a dedicated $6 per student fee (only club on campus to have their own student fee). In comparison, ASUC only gets $170k profits from the student store.",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/5ao5ar/bridges_and_qarc_get_200k_from_the_asuc_22/,2016-11-01 22:01:17,"So I was looking through the [ASUC's student activities budget](https://asuc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2016-2017-ASUC-Final-Budget-.pdf) and found that Bridges + QARC + their subsidiaries get **$200,000** from the ASUC. What do I mean by subsidiaries? Each race/ethnicity gets has their own constitute center that together form Bridges ([source](http://www.bridgesberkeley.org/about-us)). 

Additionally Bridges has their own $6/student fee that adds up to **$114,00k** (38,000 student * $6). They are the only student group with their own student fee. Not only do they get their own student fee, but they dip into the pool used by other clubs.

Here is the breakdown for ASUC funding:

Bridges Multicultural Resource Center $27,300

Arab Recruitment and Retention Center (ARRC) $600

Black Recruitment and Retention Center (BRRC) $43,800

Mixed Student Union (MSU) $0

Native American Recruitment and Retention Center (NARRC) $10,600

Pilipinx Academic Student Services (PASS) $30,600

Latinx Recruitment and Retention Center (RRRC) $50,800

Asian Pacific Islander Recruitment and Retention Center (REACH!) $19,300

Queer Alliance & Resource Center (QARC) $16,600

(It's also interesting how they literally assign a dollar amount to different race/groups.)

The ASUC gives out a total of about $900k to student groups, so that means Bridges + friends get about 22% of the total student group funding on this campus.

You can see how much ASUC gets from the student store for student activities — it's only $170,000 (it's listed as CASSA). I looked up what happens with the rest of the profits, and it seems like they are used by the Student Union to run the buildings and hire student group advisors ([source](http://asuc.berkeley.edu/news/spaces/)). 

I want to call bullshit on Bridges + QARC not receiving major advantages from the ASUC and campus. They are literally the **BIGGEST** special interest in the student group world. No other student group even comes close to getting that much money. The nearest is SUPERB which puts on campus-wide concerts at only $132,200. If you look at the ASUC budget, most clubs get only a pittance of a few hundred dollars. In addition to that, they currently have a whole floor in the basement (which is far more space than any other group) and are being offered multiple aboveground locations on a silver platter due to the protests ([source](http://asuc.berkeley.edu/news/spaces/)).

If you want to do something about it, contact your [ASUC senators](https://asuc.org/office/senate/). ASUC and senators are mostly bullshit, but they do control a lot of money. The finance committee Senators are:

Alaa Aissi (Independent but formally involved with AARC),  Chair, aaissi@asuc.org

Monsoon Pabrai (Student Action), Vice Chair, mpabrai@asuc.org

Andrew-Ian Bullitt (Student Action), abullitt@asuc.org

Benyamin Mohd Yusof (CalSERVE), bmohdyusof@asuc.org

Rosa Kwak (CalSERVE), rkwak@asuc.org

Jenny Kim (CalSERVE), jkim@asuc.org

Annie Tran (Student Action), atran@asuc.org

Note that Bridges and QARC is traditionally very closely tied to the CalSERVE party and many CalSERVE Senators are former Bridges leaders or become involved after their term. It's a revolving door, just like real lobbyists. And they pay themselves stipends too with your money! 

Luckily Student Action has a overall majority in the Senate right now, so perhaps something can change this year. Let's hold the ASUC and Student Action accountable to serving the *whole* student body. If Bridges is threatening to shut down the ASUC, starve off the limited profits from the Student Store that fund groups, and block student's access to classes because the off the great injustices they face as the number one highest funded student organization on campus at over **$300,000**, then some of that wealth should be redistributed to more worthy causes. Don't forget this in Spring when all of the parties come out for your vote.","**New info**:

[Kathy Tran](https://www.facebook.com/Office-of-ASUC-Senator-Kathy-Tran-944497852249358/?fref=ts) (CalSERVE) who was the ASUC Finance Committee Vice Chair last year (look at the top of the budget) is in the protest leadership. You can see her in the [infamous video at 1:40](https://youtu.be/3R6dzZdceT4?t=1m40s) refusing to speak to the cameraperson. I bet she wasn't so shy when she allocated her club $200,000 last spring. All links are to public pages/videos btw. 
This is literally nuts.  Like I want confirmation from another source to confirm that this is legit I'm so staggered by these numbers.

These numbers are *insane*.  And what do these groups even do?  I've never seen any of them doing anything significant.  And we're giving them tens of thousands of dollars...for WHAT?  And they're still whining?

I'm in a club that helps educate hundreds of high school students, we get a pittance from an ASUC, a few thousand or something which is a small percentage of our budget.  Another club I'm in is able to print our publication about once a semester, and that is nearly all of the money we have.  The Decal I teach gets exactly $0; we're literally applying for a grant of up to $300, a lot of the stuff we provide is provided out of our own pockets.

Meanwhile, these guys get tens of thousands of dollars to have a calendar with almost nothing on it besides staff meetings (yeah I checked their calendar) and they STILL want more space.  What exactly is it that bridges is supposed to do, host a fucking sowing circle to make minority students feel better?  Jesus christ, grow the fuck up and deal with your own shit.  Why the hell do they need tens of thousands of dollars (EACH) to host some outreach events!
It's really hard to feel bad for them (specifically with their fight on campus for more space). They're flipping the system upside down to get offered spaces nobody else would and in a process nobody else would and they're receiving an absurd amount of money relative to anyone else on campus.

That doesn't negate that there are a host of issues that face people of color and the LGBT community ... but on issues of space here on campus, I find it impossible to agree with their demands which are entirely unrealistic.
It's not like the clubs are sitting on that money -- they organize and host at least two annual national-scale conferences. Q&A (Queer and Asian) Club, a subset of QARC, organizes QACON http://www.qacon.org/, and there's also QTPOC (Queer and Trans People of Color) Conference, which is supported by Bridges and QARC together.

Because of the underprivileged nature of the attendants, they're usually greatly/fully imbursed for travel and stay, and is generally a strong outreach and support event for these people. These events also are a major part of what enforces Cal's position as a progressive campus, by hosting these outreach activities for these folks where other schools would not necessarily have the willingness to use funds on these. To this end, hosting hundreds to a thousand students from across the nation is definitely on a comparable, if not greater, scale of operations than hosting campus-wide concerts. 

We can compare this to CalHacks, which is a juggernaut operating on hundreds of thousands yet still needing more funds, and has the advantage of being funded by tech. It's significantly more difficult for QACON or QTPOC Conference to get that type of huge-scale funding from industry or even government, so they kind of have to be supported by the campus in this regard.

Whether or not you agree with the mission of these events, or if you agree that this is or isn't a good use of money, or whether or not you agree with the Fight for Spaces movement, is up to you; but it's certainly not true that they're not given the money without reason. 
ASUC? Corruption? Who knew. I'm surprised there aren't more budget hawks for an institution using tuition as a slush fund. 
Lmao given your post history I'm not surprised you don't like calserve. That line of ""remember parties when you vote!"" is such bullshit! Senate has literally not voted on anything regarding the fight4spaces campaign. Senators on both sides feel certain ways about the campaign, which is why neither major party has made a public statement about it. 

And sorry to break it to you, but student action has some pretty progressive senators, so the idea of them having a majority preventing better space allocation probably won't hold up for you 
Kathy Tran is actually the current [CalSERVE party chair](https://groups.google.com/a/asuc.org/forum/#!topic/publicnotice/ZEH_yQ8C29A).
Oh she is going to be such a great politician. 
Benyamin Yusof, current Finance Committee member is the Director of Internal Affairs for Bridges REACH! Asian Pacific Islander Recruitment and Retention Center and has been part of the orginzation for three years ([from his own campaign website](http://calserve.org/benyamin/)).
One of the things I've heard they do is host underprivileged high school students from their respective communities. They pay for all their expenses including food and transportation. That can be quite expensive depending on how many students they host (and I have no idea what that number is). And I think these outreach events are quite important in bringing and retaining students from these communities. 

But I'm also in no way affiliated with any of the bridges groups so I have no idea how they spend their money and if they're doing so responsibly. 
They have two resolutions on it pending right now that will probably go up to vote sometime in the next few weeks.

I don't really care about the spaces; Bridges has a lot already. The bigger issue is them getting $300k a year while shitting on the rest of the student body as if they were being oppressed by the ASUC/university while other clubs get mere hundreds of dollars and at best half a cubicle. Senate votes to approve and adjust this budget every single year.

I feel like most students are involved in one or more clubs and would prefer if they were funded for things that benefit them. It's simple electoral strategy given that ASUC uses proportional elections. Simply vote for people who will fund your clubs instead of this corrupt mess. Student Action senators may be progressive, but there's no revolving door with this specific organization like there is with CalSERVE. I wouldn't care if all $300k got redirected to other ethnic/multicultural orginzations, just not this one rotten behemoth.

> Lmao given your post history I'm not surprised you don't like calserve

Unlike you, I didn't create a burner account to post this. If you look at my history though, I've shat on Student Action in the past too.
Well that makes a bit more sense but the amounts they're talking about to do so seem crazy. And it also doesn't explain why they need so much space, since those events would only happen a couple times a year I assume. 
They do good work, and their share of the budget is justified considering they have to provide for communities that can't fund their own trips to Cal. Don't forget that there is a real need for groups like this.
Lots of groups on campus do good work ... but they also don't get $300,000 per year and hold the school hostage demanding unrealistic spaces on campus.
When there are severely limited resources, just having a good cause is ""not good enough"". There are scores of student groups which promote social welfare. Saying that ""Bridges does more work than those other groups"" is self-recursive, as they are the only group getting $300k. If groups promoting disability rights, environmentalism, women's rights, etc got the same amount of money they'd be able to do work of the same scale. That's not even to say that such a significant part of student fees should be spent on social justice causes. Again, these are student activities fees paid for by every student and are meant to provide for campus recreation. Somehow, I figure that your average student would not ascribe 22% of their fees to Bridges (given all other student groups they benefit from) if there was an actual democratic process to do so.

Let's now assume that the $300k should be spent on multicultural recruitment and retention purposes because all students agree that is the best use of money. Is Bridges really the best organization to administer those funds? They have shown a complete disregard for the campus and for ASUC. They have been willing to hold the student store and access to classes hostage over a petty office space dispute while refusing to even consider the offers being made. If it is determined that the $300k should go to these causes, the ASUC should put those funds out to an open bidding process. I am sure many students and student groups would line up at the door with innovative plans on how to make best use of them. This is standard operating procedure at every other level of government. Instead of forever locking in one specific self-perpetuating organization (that at the end of the day is a private organization), organizations have to compete to get government contracts to show that they can innovate and most effectively provide services to constituents. I think Bridges' conduct has cast serious light on their ability to do so.
Well, I would argue that the demands for space are somewhat unwarranted, but their operating budget is desperately needed and the work they do more important than many other student groups. Overturning the effects of generational discrimination is expensive work.
>If it is determined that the $300k should go to these causes, the ASUC should put those funds out to an open bidding process. I am sure many students and student groups would line up at the door with innovative plans on how to make best use of them.

In a way, this kind of happens. 

A bit about how the budgeting process works: During spring budgeting, all student groups ask for funding and submit a budget for what they plan on spending their money on. There are some restrictions in the ASUC bylaws that restrict how much a student group can get such as if the group is less than x amount of years old, it can only receive y amount of funding. Besides this and maybe a restriction based on number of members (see the ASUC bylaws for the exact details), it's up to the Finance Committee and Finance Officer to decide what each group gets.

So, a group CAN (eventually, after they accumulate enough years) ask for and receive that $300k that bridges gets. But why would the senators choose to give money to an organization that is less experienced and with a smaller member base than bridges? 

Also, since you do seem quite interested in this, you can see the proposed budgets of most of these groups due to the ""No budget, no pay"" act. You can access the ASUC Central Drive here: https://asuc.org/public-documents/ . Then go to ASUC Central Drive > Archive > No Budgets, No Pay 2015-2016. 
I'm the first to agree that their methods are unhelpful and ultimately harmful, as seen by the responses to their protests here. I argue (and have the evidence to back it up in the form of data on relative levels and effects of discrimination) that the need to recruit from disadvantaged racial minorities (particularly black, but others as well) is greater than the need to support women or other diverse subgroups. 
I believe that the recruitment work bridges does should be university sponsored and free from the budget constraints of the ASUC, and these protests are symptoms of a greater failing by our university to properly reach out to the disadvantages communities within our region. These protests were particularly mismanaged but there is an underlying message that does need attention. I hope in the response to their actions we don't forget why programs such as these exist in the first place.
No student group (even if it passes the probationary period where funding is limited) comes in asking for $300k because they would be laughed out of the meeting. Although, these protests have shown that trespassing in the student store and blocking Sather Gate will get you fast-lane special treatment, so maybe that'll be a new method to getting funding.

Furthermore, as shown in my other posts there is a revolving door with Bridges and CalSERVE. It's just like large corporations getting government contracts and having congressmen in and out of their boards. Except here we don't even have multiple groups competing for the same contract. Instead there is one group that seems to be perpetually locked in even when it holds the ASUC and campus hostage.
You do realize the reason it's not university sponsored is that it would be illegal? Affirmative action is illegal for public schools in California, these ""student groups"" are a way of getting around that.
> I argue (and have the evidence to back it up in the form of data on relative levels and effects of discrimination) that the need to recruit from disadvantaged racial minorities (particularly black, but others as well) is greater than the need to support women or other diverse subgroups

This is an entirely subjective statement. You may have data on the number of POC facing discrimination, but ascribing a specific measure of ""negative social utility"" to that discrimination in comparison to other social injustices is a personal moral decision. 

For the sake of a counter example, I would argue that environmental issues are more important as they not only disproportionately affect developing countries, but they also have the potential to extinguish all life on this planet (and people tend to undervalue them compared to say racial discrimination because you can see racial discrimination in the present day while environmental issues play out on a more geological scale).

Neither of our opinions is ""correct"", as they are both simply opinions. In an ideal world, there would be some system where each citizen would be fully informed of every issue and fill out a model budget for public funds, and then those budgets would be averaged. Of course that is impossible in the real world, but we have representative bodies to try to approximate it. I am convinced that Bridges is overfunded for how much value your average student ascribes to it given all pressing issues in the world (this is more of an unverified claim than an opinion, as we could test it with a survey).

And again, my point is that even if all $300k should be going to this specific subject, Bridges (the organization) has shown itself irresponsible to manage them. The funding pool should be open to other orginzations which can offer the same services (and probably at a lower cost — hello market forces).
I realize that very much. I support a return to and increased support of affirmative action. 
Well, I have assumed a measure of discrimination, in this case ability to accumulate wealth, find employment, and get an education. In this context, objectively, the discrimination facing black americans is far worse than that facing other sub groups except possibly native americans. I did not compare these issues to environmental efforts as I believe the differences between them so great as to make comparison useless. The following is an opinion: I don't believe that the budget for environmental efforts should depend on the budget for minority recruitment. Both should be funded and treated seperately.

Furthermore, that a group is being irresponsible in some ways should not be motivation for a knee jerk revocation of their operating budget. Lets take a measured response here, and remember that the issues are more complex than they first appear. I would also ask that we not let anger over their actions lead to overreaching consequences.
Well until the people of California agree with you that's not going to change, and in the meantime your idea that unrelated groups funding should be uncorrelated is impossible.

As someone who runs a student organization (not part of bridges in any way) that gets >25k/yr from the asuc, I can tell you our budget is very much affected by the limited funding of the asuc, and that bridges large amount of funding absolutely decreases other funding.

The main reason is that people have voted down increased asuc fees for general student organizations, but everyone always wants more money, so the asuc can't keep up with the ballooning need for money.

>  I don't believe that the budget for environmental efforts should depend on the budget for minority recruitment. Both should be funded and treated seperately

This is impossible in a world where resources are limited.

>I would also ask that we not let anger over their actions lead to overreaching consequences

I think that an open bidding process for other groups that want to offer the same services would be more than fair. It's a standard accountability and efficiency measure in every other level of government, the nonprofit sector, and private business. Bridges would still be able to compete in that process, it's recent conduct being noted.
[deleted]
Our world is not so limited that two operations can be budget independent. Obviously we are dealing with finite resources, but to say that the only source for funding for environmental efforts would come from the Bridges budget is absurd.

That bridges should have to compete or be held accountable seems reasonable, but to base college recruitment off of a low bid may be missing the point. 

My main concern with your statements are the punitive tones: bridges inconvenienced some of us (rudely, sure) but nonetheless it was not more than an inconvenience, and your response threatens their existence as an organization. I think the response here is as out of proportion to the protests as the protests were to the space issues in the first place.

A meritocracy only functions when everyone has equal opportunities. Black Americans face substantially more discrimination than do Asian americans and do not have access to the same quality of education (or anything - they are discriminated in every aspect and in ways that Asians are not). Affirmative action is a way to right generations worth of wrong - and your self righteous and knee jerk reaction to this topic IS enabling racism. Keep in mind that affirmative action takes many forms, and has not used quotas in the sense you mean since the Bakke case. What I'm calling for is improved and university sponsored recruitment and retention programs - not some limit on the number of Asians attending cal. That would be absurd. Try to recognize your own straw man here.
[deleted]
Well we lost rationality pretty quick here. By the way, there is no ""affirmative action in its current form."" You are arguing against something that doesn't exist and are making sweeping generalizations about racial and political subgroups. By the way, you shouldn't compare this situation to that of Jews during the holocaust, it's disrespectful to say the least.

""White oppression"" is not 100% of the reason blacks are unsuccessful in this country.

Obviously not, there is also oppression by other racial groups, as evidenced by this post. Please go learn about generational racism and implicit bias. you are ignorant of the real issues and your post is decidedly racist.

Lots of Asians get along with African Americans. You are just a racist."
"ASUC FiComm increases Bridges coalition's budget $20,000 on appeal to a total of $205,000 (not counting their $6/student mandatory fee). Bridges complains to Daily Cal that this is not enough and it's not fair that they ""have to keep going to ASUC and justify"" their funding every year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/652hhe/asuc_ficomm_increases_bridges_coalitions_budget/,2017-04-12 18:28:00,"[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hpQcfmNEHBpFuHZGF-9W6Eh50DL9wOLcxbSv3LrV-Wo/edit#gid=0) is the first draft of the ASUC budget released by the ASUC's CFO. The members of Bridges [per their website](http://www.bridgesberkeley.org/) are

* Bridges Multicultural Resource Center 
* Arab Recruitment and Retention Center (ARRC)
* Black Recruitment and Retention Center (BRRC)
* Native American Recruitment and Retention Center (NARRC) 
* Pilipinx Academic Student Services (PASS) 
* Raza Recruitment and Retention Center (RRRC)
* Asian Pacific Islander Recruitment and Retention Center (REACH!)

The initial allocation to this coalition was already a staggering $185,000, which is 22% of the $915,000 ASUC allocates to clubs through annual funding. This is in addition to the $6/student (total: $228,000 = 6 * 38,000) mandatory fee students all already pay to Bridges (source: look under campus fee [here](http://registrar.berkeley.edu/tuition-fees-residency/tuition-fees); it's listed per semester so the yearly amount is twice as much).

Bridges of course was not satisfied with a mere $432,000 and appealed for tens of thousands of more dollars to the ASUC FiComm. They even had a [facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1886636308280791/) in order to ""pack"" the committee meeting and intimidate the senators (you can see how hostile they look in the DailyCal article below). FiComm gave in and allocated $20,000 to the coalition (source: [committee minutes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19J7h-ICj7UUkUFblAfVUeGNKMWV7DnceDDZlYZEg6K4/edit)). For comparison, other appellants at the meeting included the Housing Commission which got a $300 increase to its $700 budget and the Engineering Student Council (which is made up 68 clubs) got an $1233 to their $73,500 budget.

Bridges [told the Daily Cal](http://www.dailycal.org/2017/04/11/bridges-multicultural-resource-center-campus-recruitment-and-retention-centers-fight-for-increased-funding/) that their $200,000 is ""underfunding"", that's it's not fair that they ""have to keep going to ASUC and justify"" their funding every year, and they will be seeking another referendum student fee in the future.

Remember, that this is only months after the Bridges held the ASUC's student store hostage last semester causing it to lose tens thousands of dollars in lost revenues (the ASUC also gave in there allocating them an entire floor of MLK Student Union). 

Another thing I recently learned is that the ASUC bylaws prohibit both parent and child orginzations of coalitions to apply for ASUC funding to prevent double dipping. This means that for example since Engineering Student Council is a ""parent"" organization none of their 68 ""child"" clubs can apply to the ASUC for funding. The ASUC seems to totally disregard this rule for the Bridges coalition.

The ASUC budget is not yet finalized and can still be amended. If you're interested, contact the FiComm Senators:

* Alaa Aissi (Independent, formerly involved with AARC), Chair, aaissi@asuc.org
* Monsoon Pabrai (Student Action), Vice Chair, mpabrai@asuc.org
* Andrew-Ian Bullitt (Student Action, candidate for ASUC President), abullitt@asuc.org
* Benyamin Mohd Yusof (CalSERVE, formerly director at REACH!), bmohdyusof@asuc.org
* Rosa Kwak (CalSERVE), rkwak@asuc.org
* Jenny Kim (CalSERVE), jkim@asuc.org
* Annie Tran (Student Action), atran@asuc.org

Yusof of course did not recuse himself as is required by the ASUC Constitution conflict of interests provision. Note that the CalSERVE party is extremely loyal to Bridges and has a revolving door membership. You can also contact the ASUC President, Will Morrow (Student Action), who can veto the budget at president@asuc.org, or Senator Miranda Hernandez (Student Action) at mhernandez@asuc.org who is the only self-identified ""conservative"" senator; she's not on FiComm, but can fight the bill on the senate floor.

Lastly, the ASUC election is still underway (polls close at midnight tonight) and your vote can make a difference. Senate races are lost/won by a coule of votes every year. Budgets have to be approved by a 2/3 vote, so even a few independent seats could cull this bullshit. Sadly it seems that Student Action is complacent with CalSERVE since they both voted unanimously to give into Bridge's demands last semester and on the funding appeals. The only candidates who are independent and have publicly stated they will fight special interests are the Sunny Aggarwal (/u/sunnya97), Jonathan Allen and Alexandra Tran (from the newly formed Pirate Party) and Trevor Cox.","It looks like you're trying to mention another user, which only works if it's done in the comments like this (otherwise they don't receive a notification):

Just out of curiosity, what would be the impact of the Bridges budget being eliminated in total?


It would be helpful to also know what the organization actually does - are you familiar with that? Have you asked people/reps from that organization?
I'm not a proponent of cutting the entire Bridges' budget, just bringing it into line with other clubs on campus. Given their scope of work, long history, and number of engaged students I'd give them say $50k (which is a ton of money still!) They should also be required to follow the rule on parent-child orginzations, and not be allowed to double dip by registering as 6 holding orginzations. The budget should be thoroughly audited each year (for every student organization receive large sums of money). I'm disgusted by the fact that Bridges considers itself above having to annually apply for ASUC funding through the same process hundreds of other clubs have to. However, given the intimidation and terror tactics used last semester I would also support the ASUC choosing a new organization to carry out the same recruitment and retention services. Their actions as a fund recipient are unacceptable and should lead to the termination of their relationship with the ASUC.

I do not believe that students, on average, would want to allocated 25% of their club budget to the organization and the only reason why this happens is corruption in the ASUC (the same way it happens in the real government with special interests / lobbyists getting special treatment).
I'm working off of the assumption that most people have heard of them since they caused such a ruckus last semester. Whatever they could be doing, it's not right that a quarter of all club funding goes to one special interest. 
I really need to buy gold and figure out how that works.  Golden post!
Where did you pull 50k from?
So you were able to gather and cite a great amount of info about the funding but not about what they do? All you have is an assumption. Bridges basically operates as the recruitment and retainment arm for students of color for ALL of the Berkeley campus. They work closely with administration and are not some fringe small club. Berkeley is already not competitive with gathering diverse talent because it can't compete with private schools - programs like Senior Weekend that Bridges puts on are the reason that students like me made the choice to attend Berkeley. Do more research - actually talk to someone from the bridges staff about ALL that they do - ask them for a damn budget and you'll see all the events and operations that they are in charge of.  
Nobody is saying Bridges is unimportant, but the aggressive tactics they use to take more money from other student organizations needs to end. 
That's great and all, but I don't want 25% of my student activities fee going to it. Neither do I think that most students would if they had a meaningful say in the process. Your diversity projects have no right to be subsidized by the rest of us and should look for other funding sources (member fees, tickets, university, alumni, etc). The entitlement you people have is astounding. 

There are hundreds of other clubs on campus that are just as deserving of ASUC funding students all pay into. Obviously no other clubs  put on as much programming as Bridges BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FROM ASUC (or an entire floor of the student union)!!! 

The terror tactics of the club towards ASUC last semester also make my blood boil. You shouldn't hold the hand that feeds you hostage for several months, cause it to loose thousands of dollars in revenues, and then feel fully entitled to hundreds of thousands of dollars from it. Kicking them an extra $20k (more funding than the majority of clubs get in total) in an appeal just adds insult to injury. 
IIRC students vote on their fees so people did have a say in the process at some point. And LOL @ ""you people"" and ""diversity projects"" since white folks have had supremacy projects since 5evah (Jim crow anyone? ya'll invented social projects that only benefit some). I didn't come here to win an argument on Reddit (pfft), I was pointing out that it's pretty weak to not even know what services this org does. BTW, to equivocate the increase of communities of color at Berkeley in order to increase their upward mobility with some random other club is ridiculous and telling of your perspective. We're not gunna agree and that's cool. You don't need bridges so I can see why you don't give a damn about it. Save them extra exclamation marks. 
Students vote to create a general student activities fee for ASUC to give out to clubs, not to give it to Bridges. All I hear is ""give me special treatment because of the color of my skin"" (except if it's yellow). Lol assuming my race and shit you racist.
I'm a racist because I advocated for an organization that is working to uplift communities that have strategically, over history, been ostracized from economic development?...ok guy. Your politics are basic. And Asian folks are a large component of the school population (so there's not a high need for recruitment and retention services) so I'm not sure what that is about. Have fun in your circle-jerk post."
