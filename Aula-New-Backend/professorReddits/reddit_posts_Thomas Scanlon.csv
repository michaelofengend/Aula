Scanlon or Balmer for Math 16A,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/op8t09/scanlon_or_balmer_for_math_16a/,2021-07-22 00:10:47,"I’m an incoming freshmen, trying to decide which professor to choose. For Math 16A, should I choose Richard Balmer or Thomas Scanlon? Any comments or suggestions are welcomed!","idk anything about Balmer but Scanlon is an awesome professor and id encourage people to take a class with him if possible 😃

He always goes out of his way to derive stuff and show intuitive explanations which sometimes may even touch on stuff in future classes like 54/55. In the moment you'll be like whyyy, but then on the exams and in later math classes, you'll be glad you got such a strong math background while the material is relatively easy. I took w53 with him and everyone ik that took w53 with him is super good at math though correlation≠causation. He doesn't lecture and instead gives us these good prerecorded lectures and is super lenient with covid policies and whatnot. homework is on webworks which has more tries than you need tbh and the entire class is super doable without that much effort
biased, you're his sapling
but in all seriousness yes Scanlon is a great professor (i'm taking w53 with him rn)
LOL <3"
