Math 54 Fall 2024: Sheu or Sethian,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bsqtb3/math_54_fall_2024_sheu_or_sethian/,2024-03-31 18:17:14,i plan on taking math 53 in the fall and was wondering if anyone could give me advice on whether to take it with norman sheu or james sethian. thank you!,"bro is stuck between a rock and a hard place 😭
I've heard that Sethian is absolutely amazing but his class is REALLY hard. Good luck!
sheu is annoying and teaches as if it’s the 1980s
Sethian, no doubt
Between the two I'd take Sethian. I took 53 with Canic, but from what I've heard from my friends who've had those professors, Sethian seems better
I had Sethian back in 2006. Hardest math class I ever took but he was really good.

Does he still talk about muppetspaces and muppetvectors?"
Math 1B with Sheu or Haiman ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1302jy8/math_1b_with_sheu_or_haiman/,2023-04-26 16:00:47,"Hi guys, I’m planning to take 1B next semester and I’m trying to decide between the class taught by Norman Sheu or Mark Haiman. 
Both classes work with my schedule - which class would be better professor-wise?","I stopped going to my lectures with Sheu after 3-4 weeks. He is not bad, but it honestly felt like he was just speed running the textbook instead of explaining. Maybe he got better the later weeks Idk. Also the guy doesn't bother to properly format the notes he uploads in bcourses. He just straight up takes pictures of his notes with his phone in landscape mode lol making them a headache to read.
Haiman
Preferably Haiman since it works with your schedule. I’m taking 54 with Sheu and he’s just not that good to understand the content so better not to take that option
Uh, there are formatted and typed notes for Sheu’s 54 on bcourses. The pictures that he uploads are just what he does in class since people voted for the handwritten notes over chalkboard
Why? Is he a better professor?
Oh I know, but I just find his handwritten notes annoying whenever I checked them. Not much of a problem since there are the  typed general notes as you said, but if  he is going to upload handwritten notes from class, he could at least download a scanner app at least.
No, because Sheu is the worst.
He doesn’t know what he’s doing + he teaches like he doesn’t even want to be here."

An Update to Everything Happening in Math 54,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10t23lw/an_update_to_everything_happening_in_math_54/,2023-02-03 18:02:36,"This is an update to everything that has happened in Math 54 over the past few weeks, the first post about this can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10qa5ll/an_explanation_of_whats_happening_in_math_54/).

On Wednesday night, the Math Department sent out an email saying that the replacement instructor for Dr. Talaska was going to be Norman Sheu. Up to this point, whether you were enrolled in Lecture 001 (M / W / F) or Lecture 002 (Tu / Th) in Calcentral didn't matter and you could go to either lecture and to discussions in either class. However, with Professor Sheu taking over, the email said that this would no longer be the case as the classes would be fully independent, and that students should make an effort to switch to the correct class if they weren't already.

Yesterday's lecture for Professor Wehrheim had been cancelled, but at around 3pm Prof. Wehrheim posted on the class's Ed forum. The post detailed a proposal for the class to keep relatively the same structure as before, resuming once Prof. Wehrheim returned from medical leave, which was at the very least planned until Feb. 8th. The post was long, but Prof. Wehrheim seemed to be committed to continuing the class.

Around 8 hours later, at 10pm, the Math Department sent out another email saying that Prof. Wehrheim would no longer be the instructor for Lec 002, and that they were looking for another instructor teaching the class according the standard department syllabus. Math 54 would still satisfy all university requirements and count towards pre-reqs, majors, etc., just that it would be adjusted because of the class essentially starting over three weeks in.

And now, a few hours ago, Prof. Wehrheim updated their proposal post on Ed to clarify that the Math Department had removed them as instructor without their consent and without consultation. Prof. Wehrheim mentions that they had met with the Math Department Chair Michael Hutchings on Tuesday, in which he had assured them ""it's your course, you're the boss"" and Prof. Wehrheim also uploaded all 45+ minutes of this meeting with Michael Hutchings onto the class's bCourses page. They went on to say that they would continue to ""support the learning and teaching of Linear Algebra and Differential Equations,""  apologized for everything happening to everyone taking the class, and that is where things stand now.","drama@berkeley
Lol she uploaded the meeting with the chair? Honestly her class format is pretty flawed despite being a good idea in principle, and also I was surprised how she described her format as flexible when it is the most prescriptive shit I’ve ever seen.
Just to add on, yesterday's update included stuff like:

""Students who are enrolled in Lec002 and do not take these steps to opt in are encouraged to take their own steps to switch into Lec001 — see the second paragraph above. In addition, I would provide a list of these students to our administration with the request to switch them into Lec001 — or drop them from the course if there is no substantial work in the course so far, and no explanation for that. If that turns out to be impossible, then I would assign incomplete grades to all students who have been caught in this unfortunate situation.

Students who remain enrolled in Lec002 and don’t opt in — or opt in but act in serious disrespect for our Community of Inquiry may be excluded from all support structures (including forum and take-home assessments) and assigned an incomplete grade. ""

We had to opt in (basically agree with their proposal) to stay in the class, or else you would be dropped/forcibly removed/given an incomplete.
Wait, what happened with Dr. Talaska? I had her for 10A
👀 🍿
That's crazy! Thank you for the continued updates. To all those in the class, wish you the best.
Welcome to Berkeleys, secret bad math plan. Designed to destroy society by either driving us all crazy, insisting we completely accept their math; or make us all really dumb, if we actually manage to ""learn"" it. Either way, it's an elimination of the brightest, plan. Made by those who passed and understood the bad math. 
Good luck. 
Remember variables matter.
[deleted]
Any more updates? What happened with this? Did the full 130-page manifesto get released?
Not in this class but curious: what's special about the class format?
That’s the dumbest possible take on the text you just sent. They (not she, they) literally said that you should not take their lecture if you don’t like the way they structure their class and instead take lecture 001, which is structured in a more conventional way. That is the obvious point of that post. The thing is not “take my class or get dropped or an incomplete” it is “take my class, or the other class, or get dropped or an incomplete” which seem to be the only options no matter who is teaching the course. How you got your interpretation demonstrates a shocking lack of reading comprehension.

What the post actually is saying: “switch to lecture 001 if you don’t like my class structure/if you’re not willing to do the work for the class

What you claimed it’s saying: “drop or incomplete if you don’t like my class structure” 

The two are very obviously different
Medical leave.
but she’s teaching 10B still?
Edit: I apologize for my writing. I recognize it is not my strong suit, but I tried to make it readable. Also, sorry for the long response; I think I might turn this into a post.

First of all there are no exams. Your grade is based on completing checkboxes through at home “skill quizzes”, group work, and prework before each lecture and section. Hence why this class was considered an essay A. 

In addition to that, there are no official resources for this class in terms of a textbook, slides or a lectures you could watch. Lecture is another glorified discussion section where the professor might or might not take 10 minutes to explain something. Basically you have to figure everything out by yourself. And to be fair they link some resources at the end of each worksheet which are usually mathisfun links or chapters to an optional textbook. In my and some other friends’ opinion these resources don’t usually match the depth of what we are learning.

The problem is you have 6 hours per week of mandatory class attendance divided in 3 lectures and 3 sections for Tallaska’s portion of the class (Werheim has 2 lectures of 1.5h) that are all group work and those 6 hours are accompanied by “prework” assignments that are supposed to prepare you for the groupwork. These prework assignments are also really badly written which makes it super frustrating as they are the only thing we have to work with. 

Anyways, these format of “inquiry based learning” could work if they gave you a foundation before group work (maybe let lectures be lectures) and the only materials the class relies on were well written. 

Lastly, a side note about accessibility:

I am sure Werheim had the best intentions, but I feel she achieved the opposite of what she was aiming for.  Sure, this class is an easy A and not a gatekeeping class, but students without a strong math background and time are going to have a bad time regardless of the grade. There’s a way more efficient way of making you think critically without wasting your time. Who is at an advantage here? The student who has 10-20 hours of part-time work or the student who doesn’t need to work to afford Berkeley (assuming a normal workload of 4 courses for both)? Sure, I get the thing about thinking critically and asking questions but university is also about sharing knowledge and giving you some things chewed as bad as it sounds. A lot of courses at Berkeley give you a foundation and then let you branch out from there by giving you hard problems to think about without reinventing the wheel into a square.

Furthermore, as a student with ADD this class was a nightmare. I like group work, but I cannot concentrate when all those 6 hours of mandatory attendance are group work. I am basically coming into these classes naked in terms of preparedness because the prework worksheets don’t give you any solid foundation and are badly written. Then I have to theorize with other groups talking all around me for a whole hour with my own group which is often also unprepared. Somehow I am expected to be focus and productive under all these circumstances. 

There are very few cases where I can see a class format like this working without being inaccessible. You have to have a very light courseload and the learning materials for the class are appropriate and not some messy overcrowded badly written mess of a weekly worksheet. 

I really don’t know what is going on Werheim’s mind to think this course is flexible and accesible. 

 Finally, a clarification before I end the comment. I don’t want to make it sound like I hate the idea of going to class by talking about the mandatory attendance. In fact I usually go to every lecture and section in my classes even if they are not mandatory. However, the lack of flexibility and super prescriptive format (6 hours of group work divided in 6 classes preceded by mandatory prework for each one) is frustrating. We are students, but we are also people with lives and responsibilities outside school.

Oh I'm sorry to hear that, she was always so nice to me.
Oh wait idk if she's teaching 10b this semster, I had her 2 years ago
Yes I'm in 10B and she is still teaching it.
This format also sounds like a nightmare for people on the autism spectrum. 6 hrs/wk of group work?
Wow, if you have a schedule conflict you have to take the only class available, & if you don’t like the only class available, you have to incomplete or drop. What part of this is specific to how they teach the class and not something that would be completely the same in literally any other class???

Edit: they blocked me and Reddit cared me for this lmao so idk what their actual reply is
It is funny that we had an assignment about privilege and disadvantages that people may have (invisible disabilities, low income, etc.) and then she creates a course like this lol
[deleted]
And these people are teaching math
Except you do realize how that expectation is not only completely reasonable but literally impossible for them to do otherwise? If you don’t like the class, aren’t willing to do it, and have a time conflict for the other lecture, literally what other option do you have lol?

They Reddit cared me too, imagine telling everyone who points out how stupid you’re being to k*ll themselves lol"
Schedule for incoming Data Science Major,https://i.redd.it/ufm0xpm14kbb1.jpg,2023-07-12 08:58:51,"Hi everyone! Here is my schedule for this incoming fall as a freshman. Please let me know if you have any advices on this or thoughts. I’m worrying this might be too much so what course should I drop and what should I take instead? I’m thinking about drop COMLIT R1A and take something lighter as this is 4 units. The reason I want to take CS61A is because I also want to do a double major or minor in CS or potentially declare CS later. Please lmk your thoughts! Thank you so much. 
Go Bears!","Hi, I'm an applied math and stat double major and I think your schedule is fine, although it may be a little work intensive! 

One thing to note is that 61A is often quite difficult for people who have no coding experience (my friend really struggled, like it was one of her worse semesters), so if you're worried, I would suggest getting the basics of coding in python down over the summer (you can google past cs61A websites, here's the one that gets updated/reset every semester https://cs61a.org/)! Also as a tutor in CSM, I will say that if you're finding 61A to be difficult, CSM can be a great resource. I personally found 61A to be relatively reasonable but that was because I took AP Computer Science A back in high school so I had most the fundamentals down.  
I did not take Math 1B at Berkeley so I have no idea how it's like, but if it's like most math classes at Berkeley, it will likely be very dependent on the professor (it also may be a weeder class? so be careful). However, unlike most math classes, there are a lot of resources online for Calculus so hopefully you'll be fine! (To be honest, if you need help in 1B you can DM me and I'll try my best to help or jsut check out something like Khan Academy or reading your textbook)  
Data 8 is generally pretty chill. KEEP UP WITH THE WORK. The professor you have is the professor I had for Data 100, and she's decent, but a little dry. I think that just doing the labs and homework will be most effective.

I have no idea how work intensive COMLIT R1A will be because it depends on the class and the prof, but if you're afraid grading, I would go on Berkeley time and look for a class that had a good average and fulfills a breadth or requirement (https://berkeleytime.com/landing).
Set up a tent in Wheeler.
I’m a transfer student so yet to take my first semester of classes (I will this fall). My question is, how are you going to get from your 10am to 11am? Won’t they be back to back?
pretty standard, should be a busy but very doable semester! stay on top of things and you'll be fine.
Solid. No offense but this might be the most average schedule I've ever seen.
Doable, probably on the slightly harder side for most. If you wish to lighten it slightly but still make progress toward your degree(s) I suggest taking a breadth in place of 61A and to take 61A in the spring.

Also, save your physical sciences breadth in case you minor or major in CS since 61C will cover it.
Thank you so much for your help!!!
Berkeley time - classes start 10 min after the listed time
They’re in the same hall too, they just needs to go upstairs
Wow wish I knew this before registration opened
Wish I knew this too! I didn’t see it in the orientation. Good to know! Thanks!
Oh man yeah I think it says it in the online orientation thing but if the classes you want still have spots you can probably still change it around
Ya a kinda rushed through it. Thanks for letting me know"
New professor for Math 53?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vtlqhp/new_professor_for_math_53/,2022-07-07 08:49:22,"I was thinking of taking Math 53 with Canic but I just went on the Berkeley Academic Guide and I guess there's a new professor, Norman Y Sheu instead. He's not on Berkeleytime so I'm not sure how he grades. 

Should I risk it or should I take the class with Sethian?

And on a side note, does anyone know why lecture times for Math 53 are so weird? It's either a class that starts at 8 am or a class that ends at 7:30 pm.","if you take 53 with sethian invite me to your funeral
I’m was gonna take 54 and 55 because the other professors for 53 are hard af, but ima enroll with Norman. If it’s his first year, I guess he’ll most likely be easier and flexible
>Should I risk it or should I take the class with Sethian?

I've got something to tell you....
PLZ NO SETHIAN, I DONT KNOW NORMAN, BUT SETHIAN IS DEATH, luv canic!!
I’m gonna play Devil’s Advocate. Yes, Sethian was definitely atleast 1.5 times the work than Canic’s class, but I think the way he pace’s the class is actually really really good and his lectures are way way better. He makes the material intuitive and super easy to understand.
did you take 53 with Sethian? I've also been trying to decide between Sethian and Sheu.
Lmao Norman it is then!

i personally didnt but sethian is famous for his C+ section avg and i have a few friends who got choked by the amt of hw he assigns and his exams too. I've never heard of sheu so maybe a new prof for 53. sethians a good guy tho, very passionate and charming.

edit: looks like norman sheu's a youngster that just graduated from uc davis phd (he's also a cal alum) and started lecturing this summer.
any updates on how it went
Thank you for the info! So basically I gather that it will be hard for me to get an A in Sethian's class considering that I am not math genius!
Sorry dude I actually didn't need the math req
haha, honestly you don't need to be a math genius to do well in his class--just that more effort is required. but for most classes you can do well if you focus and put in the effort. hope all goes well!

Fall Schedule,https://i.redd.it/3f47pmbtnecb1.jpg,2023-07-16 15:43:06,This is my schedule for the fall trying to declare Econ and trying to double in CS. I’m aware that it’s going to be intensive but it’s really my only option.  Wondering if anyone had any tips tackle all these classes at once. Thanks.,"Upside down staircase again but the other way instead. It’s not that bad tbh. Didn’t they say that you could only major in one high demand major or no?
Wouldn’t recommend 101B if you’re taking 1B at the same time. It just feels like you won’t be ready mathematically
Ok I hope it’s not too too bad. That’s only for freshman. L&S advising said I’d be able to which is cool.
The thing is I kinda have to if I wanna declare Econ because the 100 series is full. I think I’ll be alr since I took up to multi in hs and I’m gonna try to refresh before the sem.
Oh you’re a current student? If so then you’re fine.
I’m a one year transfer.
You need to declare cs by summer then shouldn’t be too bad if you have experience
Yeah I think it’ll be alr. I have minimal experience but I’ve been prepping this summer. Need a 2.7 this fall for Econ prereqs and 3.3 for CS prereqs by summer."
My guide to picking out classes.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d3rrmu/my_guide_to_picking_out_classes/,2024-05-29 18:01:28,"Hi yall, I've noticed its that time of year where people are starting to ask about what courses to take/what schedule to do so I'm just gonna write down what I personally think and I hope it'll help some people.

Here's a few things I want to address first to the people who are coming in from hs since I've found hs classes and college classes are vastly different and they take a lot of getting used to for a good chunk of people. Here's what I found that are different abt college classes vs hs classes.

1. Classes are always graded not on how well you do objectively, but how well you do relative to your classmates. That means no more 90% = A and 80% = B, and so on. Instead, what will matter for your grade will largely be three things - your score, the average score, and the standard deviation of your score. Basically these things can tell you how well you did relative to your classmates and will largely determine your grade. This also means that you don't need to be discouraged if/when you come out of an exam knowing you probably got less than a 70% on an exam. There's a good chance that exam was just hard. In fact, a 50% or so was enough to get an A comfortably in some of my classes so please don't take it to heart and give yourself a hard time if you don't do very well objectively.

  
2. Professors can make or break your class. In highschool, there's usually only a few teachers who teach each class, maybe 2-3 and they all basically teach the same things because there are guidelines (such as common core or AP guidelines) that shape what will be taught in your class. This reduces the amount of variance in hs classes and that makes it so that what teacher you get usually doesn't matter too much. In college, your professors kinda have free reign on what they cover and how they cover. Different iterations of a class can have very largely differing content and difficulty so I'd highly reccommend looking up who is teaching the classes you want to take and see if they are well liked (a common tool for this is ratemyprofessors.com). (footnote 1

3. You have complete freedom over whatever you take and it's all up to you. You guys are legally adults now (or at least fairly close to it. If you're one of those kids who are at college at the age of 13 I don't think this post is for you to begin with). It's not up to any person to choose what you take and I personally believe that you can ask for people's advice/opinions on stuff but you ultimately make the decision. Don't let anyone (including me) dictate what you should do.

4. Depending on where you come from, the classes here may seem much harder relatively. This is a common thing I've seen in a lot of people and I just want to tell you that you're not alone and I believe you guys can do it if you put in enough effort. I could make a whole thing about my advice for this stuff but that's off topic.

Ok I think that's all the major differences between college and hs classes I can think of rn. Let's carry on to choosing courses.

1. The unit system is a scam and don't believe it. They say that each unit will take a student approximately 3 hours/wk but this could not be any less true. There are some classes that will quite literally take you 3 hours every month even though they have 3-4 units (footnote 2). Other classes are notorious and take a lot of people 20+ hrs/wk even though the 4 units suggests it should be 12. A particularly infamous example of this one would be CS 70.

1.1. Just tacking along, this also means that classes vary a lot in difficulty so it's usually kind of pointless to ask people if taking a certain number of units is a good choice because taking 16 units can mean anywhere from ""I have basically no work to do and can fuck around every day"" to ""I'm taking way too much because I'm taking 4 of those 20 hour courses and basically working 2 full time jobs""

2. Thus, it's improtant to figure out what classes are relatively easy and what classes are relatively hard. There's two methods I'd suggest.

2.1 First is you just look for it on google/reddit. A lot of classes (especially the cs ones) have people commenting on the class if you just look for ""\[Insert name of your class\] berkeley reddit"" such as ""CS 70 berkeley reddit."" Also another tip I've found is most of the times where you don't get results ur satisfied with, try asking google a phrase of all the keywords you want instead of asking ""What is the difficulty of CS 70 at berkeley like."" Dont have any evidence to prove it but personally its worked so if you want u can give it a try.

2.2 Try taking the classes yourself. ADJUSTMENT PERIOD IS YOUR BIGGET FRIEND!! You can enroll in up to 20 units and so what I'd reccomend is just enroll in an extra class or two that you are thinking about taking and see what all the classes are like for the first week or two. Then, you can have first hand experience with the workload of the class and you can determine if you think you can take it yourself instead of having to rely on what other people say.

3. It's usually pretty pointless to ask ""Is this a good schedule or is this too much."" Everyone is at different skill levels and you kinda have to account for that. I know a lot of people who struggle with getting by at 13 units while there are also some people who take 30+ units and still thrive. Don't go hating on everyone who asks these questions but ultimately, the answer to any of these questions will always be ""depends on who you are and how good at this stuff you are."" You guys have 4 whole years here and just take it slow and figure out what pacing is good for you instead of forcing yourself to go along with what is ""normal."" You can finish basically any degree taking less than 12 units/sem if you don't do any other classes for fun. Not that I'd reccomend doing that cuz please take a courses that interest you but I just wanted to put that there for people who are worried they're behind. You're gonna graduate on time anyways with the same degree as everyone else so who cares.

4. Speaking of fun classes, theres this thing called decals here which are student led classes and there are a lot of interesting ones so I'd reccomend you look at them and see if there are any that interest you. Similarly, there's courses that are titled freshman/sophomore seminars which are classes where you don't have much work and you listen to ur profs talk abt a variety of subjects. If you don't know what to take it might be nice looking for one of these that fit your taste.

Uh I feel like that's all i have for rn have a good day yall and hope this helped. Comment if there's anything that you disagree w or want to add and I'll try to take it into account. Oh also i didnt know what flair to use so uh i'll just got w other.

Foonotes

1. An example from my first sem here was math 53 taught by James sethian vs Norman sheu. Sheu's class had hws that were graded much more leniently and had about 1/3-1/2 the length of Sethians. Idk if sethian did this but Sheu gave extra credit for attendance + released ""practice exams"" for all the exams that were basically the same things with numbers tweaked or a small twist.

2. (in my case, nus ctx 11 was this for me. Nothing requried except 5 hws and 3 open note, mc, online, exams. hws are super short and you literally just skim the notes/ctrl f for keywords and you can finish each in an hour or so. Everyone I knew taking the class also didn't study for the exams at all/minimally and got A-s or As just by looking up answers on the fly). ","who is taking 30 units
incoming transfer here, thanks for the advice!
Bump!
honestly pretty solid except for a few exceptions / clarifications i'd make but i'm kinda lazy
I know like 3  people. 2 of them I'm not personally acquainted w them but theyre friends of friends. Last one he's planning on doing like 4 majors he's crazy.

~~no it's katrin wehrheim~~

It's both professors currently teaching math 54, including: Wehrheim and Talaska
Thanks! Was planning to take 54 next semester. For a moment I thought the 54 was in some kind of limbo. Hope it gets resolved gracefully for those in W’s class.
ok thanks for the info. generally the math 54 profs have been flaky so with everything popping up, i wasn't sure what was happening."
Will I manage?,https://i.redd.it/8mcc59lx1sbb1.png,2023-07-13 11:41:15,Will this be manageable for a freshman? I'm tryna maintain a 3.5gpa or above as well.,"If I see another redditor that's gonna say that this is doable, I swear to fucking god. This is not doable under any circumstance if you consider you mental health, a balanced life, and a guaranteed higher GPA a key priority. You're gonna have to work on Physics 2 hours a day, Chemistry for an an hour and a half, math for an hour and half, and english for about an average of an hour a day. Please save Physics for another semester and protect your GPA. Only your grades show up on your transcripts, not how fast you finished your techs.
What's your major
background is kinda important especially because a bunch of those are weeders. if you're willing to spend all of your time outside of classes doing busy work you could take a shot, personally i'd save physics for another sem.
What would you recommend replacing physics with? Physics was a backup to engineering 26, I'm WL'd on that. Chemistry I just want to do as well. Also thanks for an honest answer I was thinking it's too much, just got no idea how hard anything is.
Applied math with a focus on engineering or astrophysics. I'm undecided so I'm doing as many prereqs as I can while staying in the unit limit.
Physics is a replacement for engineering 26 since I'm on the WL for that at spot 5. I'm hoping that I'll be able to get it instead.
Either a 1 unit decal course or an easy elective that can help satisfy your AC requirement. I'm also telling you this without knowing your overall plan in terms of either finishing some stuff early or if you wanna front load classes to accomplish some research down the road. Regardless, chemistry, math, english and some other bullshit class is already enough. I also want to take the moment to say that in this sub, ppl always say that something is either ""doable"" or ""not impossible"" but, frankly, I think alot of people are out of touch of reality in terms of what a proper healthy workload is. I think you'll do well if you earn all A's on a lighter workload, take up some extracurriculars, and develop some relationships with professors to get a chance at having research down the road. Doesn't make sense to take more techs right now.
Hm gotcha, I mean this is a heavy load but not impossible. I definitely wouldn't recommend doing physics 7a and chem 1a at the same time typically but I get you're trying to figure out what you wanna do. Although if you're not doing chem1AL it shouldn't be as bad, not sure if that was intentional or not. If you're more into physics then might just be better to swap out chem for something else though
i'd like my chances for getting into e26, a bunch of ppl will drop. 7a is a pretty gigantic jump in workload compared to that so i wouldn't exactly recommend that schedule. not entirely impossible but you will hate yourself.
Alright. I'm most likely gonna replace Chem 1A since I want to knock out ME Minor requirements, and physics would be more useful for my later plans."
SP23 Semester Reflection,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13utrcw/sp23_semester_reflection/,2023-05-29 05:38:55,"If you want to put my comments below into context, 61A was my first time coding and my only math experience comes from AMC 8/10 (which I took once a year without studying & never advanced past 1st round).

CS 61B: 10/10

* Favorite part of the class was learning Hug’s approach to asymptotics; personally thought that these questions were a lot more fun than straight up coding on exams
* Liked the customizability of the class (different difficulties for discussion, optional discussions & labs, etc.); liked the concept of pacing points which both helps struggling students and doesn’t hurt those who operate more independently of the class schedule
* The projects aren’t as bad as they’re made out to be; some are time-consuming but I think a lot of the extra time spent on them is a result of not watching the applicable lecture(s) first. For example, project 2B took me a long time but I realized after the fact that there was 1 lecture that pretty much told you how to set it up.
* Honestly y’all were way too mean to Yokota lol (idk anything about 61C but just from a 61B perspective). Most of the memes are pretty harmless but the “fuck you”s are unwarranted. I think MT2 and the final were harder than they maybe should’ve been (walked out of both thinking I messed up big time), but in retrospect the exams weren’t as terrible as I thought they were in the heat of the moment. Part of the shock factor was probably because MT1 was written a bit too easy.

CS 70: 8/10

* I personally really enjoyed the rsa/secret sharing/error correcting codes part of the class
* Overall I think this class isn’t really the villain it’s made out to be. It’s without a doubt the most challenging content I’ve ever learned (walked out of MT1 genuinely in awe of whatever the hell just happened lol) but at the same time you don’t need to understand everything. Knowing and having applied the general techniques on things like discussions worksheets (i.e. removing a vertex and adding it back in during a graph-related inductive proof) is enough.
* Don’t waste your time trying to learn everything about stable matching, for instance. Those true/false questions are pretty much just a crapshoot and doing 1 or 2 past exams for instinct is all you really need (even if you miss all of those true/false, it doesn’t really matter). This rings even truer for countability/computability; just write down what general things are countable from the notes/discussion/csm and reference those if needed, otherwise make your best guess.
* Attending discussion was pretty useless tbh (although I do think the worksheets themselves were good). I was consistently like \~3 weeks behind so I didn’t understand the words being tossed around until much later & kinda just stopped going after I got my 13 mandatory ones (obviously I do not recommend digging yourself this hole lol). I do appreciate how they started hosting review discussions though.
* Use CSM! Honestly my mentor was not so good at explaining things but I still went during the 1st half of class because it was a nice way to stay somewhat on track and have people to talk to about 70 if your friends aren’t in the class with you.
* I think the best experience you can have in this class is grinding during the discrete portion to get a good grade on MT1, then (hopefully) choosing the no homework option and chilling for the 2nd half. As much as I hated doing the discrete homeworks, I think that they honestly did help me prepare for MT1 (and if everything works out, you’ll never have to look at a probability hw question). As far as study resources go, I’d say discussion worksheets > csm worksheets > hw (past exams considered separately since you kinda have to do them).

MATH 54 (Sheu): -/10

* Had Norman last semester for 53 and it was pretty much the exact same experience: no need to go to lecture, the textbook is your bible. Only difference was not having quizzes in 53, which was nice.
* I really don’t have anything to say about this class; I didn’t even give it a number rating because imo it was just a standard math class. 

MUSIC 26AC: 9/10

* Liked the content and appreciated getting to learn about the cultural and historical motivations behind a lot of different genres of music. I know that ESPM 50AC is another popular choice for ac but from what I’ve heard music has a lot less reading. I’m not exaggerating when I say that this class is legitimately the equivalent of 1 unit (\~3 hours of work per week). If you 2x speed the lectures (since there’s not much to process, just info to learn) and do the weekly hw, it’s honestly less. Highly recommend.

CS 198-134 (Quant Decal): 7/10

* Definitely take if you’re interested in learning about the space, very nice survey
* Not sure how this will change in following semesters but the Thurs 8-10 time slot was slightly annoying

BIOENG 25: 

* Remnant of being an ex bioe major

UGIS 192B: 4/10

* This means nothing since every lab is different, but personally my urap experience was not super fulfilling, just extra workload on top of other stuff I already had to do. If your reason for applying for research is just to try it out (like mine was), I’d apply to projects you are genuinely interested in instead of settling beforehand and applying to less interesting ones that you think might be less selective. Worst case you get rejected and have more free time","100% agree w ur review on CS 70
I took the quant decal too, what did you think of the HW? The last parts of HW3 were undoable until I talked with a staff on Ed and they fixed it. Similar to an error on HW2. I love the instructors though and I hope to join Traders at Berkeley. I hope my resilience and curiosity that led me to help fix the HW while most other people (I heard) just submitted an empty dataframe to pass the test cases will help me when applying."
