Is this a reasonable first semester schedule? Intended Data Science major,https://i.redd.it/dqtfzkcm57bb1.png,2023-07-10 13:29:10,,"I would say this schedule is 3 techs and not recommend it unless you’re fully prepared to dedicate most of your semester to grinding. If it’s your first semester, I’d recommend taking 2 techs at max mainly to 

1) get acclimated to cal academics -wise 

2) meet people and hang out etc 

Lmk if you have more Qs
i would definitely push back math 54 to focus on data 8 & cs 61a

math 54 is not easy for most and the 61a&data8 combo is pretty busy
You’re good but it’s on the heavier side. There’s the 10m berkeley time. Wheeler and Li Ka Shing is kinda far but Dwinelle and Wheeler is close
LKS to Dwindelle is an end zone to end zone TD run. So a walk is a few minutes at most. But from LKS to Wheeler, it’s about 4x to 5x farther. Stankova (math) will keep you very busy but you also learn a lot in her class. 53 not needed for 54. Data 8 will be mostly busy work but not as difficult. CS 61a is a big weeder class… very helpful to read up ahead… https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/archives.html

As most here would warn… taking more than 2 techs on your very first semester is risky. You’ll have plenty of time get these courses done. Could unload 1 tech to get acclimated, meet people, and join clubs.
Hi! I'm a incoming freshman who is intending to declare Data Science. I was just wanted to get some advice from past students on if this schedule would be too difficult for my first semester. Specifically, I've gotten a 5 on Calc BC but I haven't learned multivariable calculus (Math 53), so I was wondering if Math 54 would be too big of a jump. I've also taken AP CS and AP Stats. Also, would it be hard to get to each class on time if they're back to back? Thanks in advance!!
i did math 54/61a/anthro 3ac/bioe 10 my first sem and that was maxing myself out - if you have a good background in cs/math/ds, then this should be plenty doable. if you’re like me and this’ll be your first cs class or your first hard math class, it may be a bit too much
CS 61A is rough. If you’re good at programming the workload is easy-moderate, but the tests are hell.

Math 54 is tough like any math class, but there are certainly worse ones around (1B, 53, 104, COMPSCI 70). The material isn’t the worst, but it’s not a joke either. The workload during the semester should be ok, it’s a bit much over the summer.

Data C8 I haven’t taken, but if it’s anything like STAT 20 it’s pretty easy. It still requires a bit of work though. And it might be harder than STAT 20; hard to say.

Sociology 3AC is probably fine. I would pass no pass it.

Your overall workload is completely fine if you’re good at math and CS and don’t take on too many extracurriculars. With clubs and research it might get tough.
I would echo earlier comment on 3 techs at least for first sem. Also is there a reason ur taking 61A and not 88 if u know ur data science. 88 covers all the important parts of 61A while being less intensive and I was just as prepared for 61B compared to peers who took 61A
Contrary to what some other comments are saying, I think this is a reasonable schedule.

This was basically my schedule for my first semester (though I didn't take Sociology 3AC), and it was fine. In fact, most of the semester was just spent idling around to be honest.

For reference, I went into 61A after only taking APCSA my last semester of senior year, and had no prior experience for Math 54. For Data 8, I had already taken AP Stats and APCSA.

In terms difficulty for your techs, I would say 61A > M54 > D8.

For 61A, the coursework itself should be guaranteed full points if you are on top of things. The main concern would be exams, as the difficulty for exams is way higher than coursework; make sure to grind A LOT of practice exams early.

For Math 54, the proofs can get tricky at times, but it isn't too bad to be honest. I would recommend to maybe read ahead a bit and have a good grasp of the concepts as they are very interconnected.

For Data 8, the class is honestly free if you have prior experience in APCSA and AP Statistics. Stats will be very helpful for the probability section and also some stuff like hypothesis testing/confidence intervals/etc. The ""coding"" done in the class is also very straightforwars; it is mostly just knowing their custom DS Python Library and remembering the different tests.

Best of luck with your studies🫡
Depending on how strong in math/CS you are, this isn't the worst schedule imo. I'd recommend just doing the 3 techs just so that you can get them out of the way for other tech classes next sem + slightly lighter courseload. You can do CSM for a PNP unit to get to the 13 unit threshold. I did math1b + data 8 + 61a fall sem and it was ok!
I took a very similar course load my first semester and I was okay; but I don’t recommend it. Try to stick to 2 techs max first semester, and ease into it.
Reasonable for a first semester freshman? No.

Doable? Yes, but either you have a very strong math/coding background or you’re willing to give up any social life.
I think your sched is fine, depending on your academic background.  As an anecdotal example, my kid skipped Calc and did 61A/Data 8/EECS16A his first semester, and although he’s a smart guy from a very competitive HS, I wouldn’t really consider him to be a brilliant student by any means if I’m honest. Didn’t get all A’s but he did fine and he had plenty of time for basketball and activities. 

The one thing I will say is that you should seriously consider what your domain emphasis is going to be.  Some domains, like Business Analytics or Cognition, the first class will cover your Social Sciences breadth. So taking Sociol 3A may be a waste if taking a breadth is what your intention was.  Being a DS major will probably cover 3 of your 7 breadths if you plan things right.  If you’re going to take a breadth, take a Arts & Literature breadth - chances are no domain emphasis class will double dip that breadth.
How many units is that? I would not go over 15 but tbh I’d stick to just 13 especially 1st sem
if you took ap stats and have any kind of programming experience, data 8 is less work than most breadths. I wouldn't get too scared off by the whole ""3 techs"" thing.

I would consider this an ""average"" schedule, not a particularly difficult one.
Yeah this schedule should be fine

I see white space on your schedule so you’re likely not doing enough 👍
Why take CS61A? I guess if you have prior coding experience then it's okay. You're going to have an exam like 2 weeks into the semester
intended DS major here - depends on what you consider difficult. am personally glad I took D8 first sem & 61A the next, to get a feel for how hard courses would be here. nice breadth & American Cultures in one.
This would involve sitting indoors for 90% of the day, unless you're willing to study outside :)
Looks fine to me. Just keep in mind that CS61A and Math 54 are sophomore level classes, and they will be significantly harder than Data C8. Sociology 3AC is an American Cultures class, so it will likely be really easy (think standard high school class easy)
+1, i completely lost out on doing clubs, going out as much, and overall a sense of adjusting to college life bc i was just juggling 2 techs and 2 breadths (which eventually becomes a norm but was a bit too heavy for me my first sem). i strongly recommend taking a slightly easier courseload than you think you can handle just so that you can pursue other interests/make friends/apply to and join clubs
Thank you for the reply! I def dont want to overload myself first semester, would you recommend pushing back 61a or math 54 to second semester? I was thinking of taking 61b and math 54 together 2nd sem but that also sounds pretty tough.
Hi, i’m doing data c8, data c88, and mcb c100a. 

would this be considered 3 techs?
data 8 is a very light tech, I think this is fine tbh.

obviously depends on the person though
This depends a lot on the person/their background. I took 4 techs my first semester and I was fine academically and I had a ton of time to meet people and hang out (nevermind that I mostly spent it watching anime and playing LoL).
huh aren’t dwinelle and wheeler right by each other?
Thats the usual path for people who take BC so you’ll be fine. And every class operates by Berkeley time (starts 10 minutes after listed time) so having back to back classes is doable. But make sure to factor in some time to eat within your schedule
I think c8 and math 54 wouldnt be too hard for you! However, like everyone else says, 3 tech is time consuming, esp with cs61 series which is just a pain overall for everyone. It might not be particularly hard, but it's definitely a grind. Just choose any 2 of those and you should be fine! If you're you wanna take cs61a, then take an easy breadth with it. If you dont wanna take 61a, you can go for another breadth that you are interested in but might take more time out of you.
Your schedule is ambitious but totally doable imo. I think for Data Science, it is the right call to take 54 before 53 as linear algebra is very important. I would rather over commit the first semester than under commit and be bored. Back to back classes are my preference. The Cal campus is small so you should be totally able to go between the classes without issue. I hate small breaks in my schedule since I find that they are not very useful.
I don't really have a good reason haha, I was just interested in the material that 61a covers. Do you think taking 88 would be better than 61a?
Maybe you were just particularly good, but C88 does not prepare you the way 61A does. OP will have to take 61B, and likely two upper division CS courses + CS 189 at some point. It’s best to prepare with 61A imo.
no do premed instead
61b+54 is fine, good blend of project and pset actually
Not a mcb major, but c100a is considered difficult 😥
I don’t know anything about bio or mcb etc but most stem classes would be classified as a “tech”
Transfer student?
Yes but across a open space.
I took another look at your schedule. Wheeler to Dwinelle is no problem as they are right next to each other. I went between those exact 2 rooms in the reverse order this spring without any issue. Li Ka Shing to Wheeler isn't bad either
Take 61a and keep ur options open, you will learn more too
0.0.. Might have to reconsider my schedule. Not sure if its doable now. Ill try to lighten it up with some summer classes and cc classes. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NGukdXbrzaiBRT9z04bOfLVWWtZT46HIN6CeEsfmTlA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NGukdXbrzaiBRT9z04bOfLVWWtZT46HIN6CeEsfmTlA/edit?usp=sharing) Though I have a question, If I do spread my classes out further, my semesters will only have 8 units of my required classes. What do I take to reach 13 units for full time status?
alright thanks!!
Yup, I am now rethinking my schedule as double major in mcb and data science. Maybe ill just take some cc classes for linear algebra and data 8. That should lighten the load for sure. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NGukdXbrzaiBRT9z04bOfLVWWtZT46HIN6CeEsfmTlA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NGukdXbrzaiBRT9z04bOfLVWWtZT46HIN6CeEsfmTlA/edit?usp=sharing)  
that's my schedule idk if u know anything about those classes?   


Ill try to add some summer classes to lighten the load more i guess. Though I have a question, If I do spread my classes out further, my semesters will only have 8 units of my required classes. What do I take to reach 13 units for full time status?
It’d add like 30 seconds to the walk at most
Agreed! Same courses but who knows you might wanna change to cs major 🤷‍♀️
It’s actually doable. Just got to stay focus and on top of your workload and schedule. C8 is mostly busy work. C88 is CS61a lite.

Your spring schedule is more difficult because of cs61b. By mid-fall you’ll gauge better on how you can handle spring schedule.
>alright thanks!!

You're welcome!
1. You should have taken linear at CC. If not, you won't be able to until next summer before doing Data 100 in the next fall.
2. As a transfer, you are expected to take 3 techs every semester since both of your major are tech.
3. I highly recommend that you take a couple of courses in Berkeley Summer like Upper Div American Culture and maybe Data 100.
its gonna be basically impossible now with the recent changes
Thanks so much!! Yea I should be able to gauge my workload by then"
Sociology 3ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/impohm/sociology_3ac/,2020-09-04 15:23:24,I just enrolled in socio 3ac with mary kelsey today and was just wondering about the workload of the class and how difficult it is to get an A?,"Not a difficult workload at all. There's a good amount of reading but it's not enforced and is mostly just a preview of what she talks about in lecture. The only major assignment is the research paper towards the end of the semester and you have plenty of time to do it. One of the easiest A's I've had at Berkeley.
Thank you for the reply! Is she pretty lenient on grading the essays cuz I’m not the strongest writer 😂
She has readers grade the paper so it depends on who you get. Hopefully they still do this but the semester I took it each reader had office hours where you could bring in a rough draft of your paper and get comments on it, which was really helpful because they're the one grading it. Overall though the requirements were very straightforward and clear so if you put in the time getting an A is definitely feasible."
SOCIOL 3AC vs INTEGBI 35AC,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hvt5mj/sociol_3ac_vs_integbi_35ac/,2020-07-22 05:46:55,"Has anyone taken SOCIOL 3AC with professor Mary Kelsey? If yes, could you share your experience of the class and the professor? As of now, I am waitlisted for the class but chances are that I might get in (and if I do, I plan on dropping INTEGBI 35AC). Thank you!","Haha it seems that you already had your own decision, but I still want to say something about INTEGBI 35AC. I took it in Fall 2019, my first semester at Cal, and ended up with an A+. The course was highly organized, with all the modules and schedules of each class posted on bcourse before the class really began. What attracted me was this course did not have midterms or final, but only a final paper that was graded in a very lenient way. I really hate exam settings, no matter how easy the exam actually is. Also, I remember there were not many high-rating courses that fulfill the Biology Breadth. 

If you check out the grade distribution on berkeleytime, you will see it is really easy to get an A in this course, and it truly was. Moreover, I really like Prof. Hlusko, her passion in her field inspired me in my future academic pursuit, I wish to become this woman one day. I know it is a relatively unpopular class. I enrolled in this class because I did not get off the waitlist of another popular course, and I really appreciate to have this chance to learn with Prof. Hlusko when I first came to Cal.
I took Sociology 3AC with her a while ago. She’s a very good lecturer, she’s very kind and understanding, as well as being help with the content during her office hours. In terms of the workload, I thought it was fair for a 4 unit class. IIRC, there is a participation grade (iClickers), and your grade is based off of 3 essays rather than exams. It might sound like a lot, but she’s really helpful and always knows how to guide you in the right direction. She’ll actually listen to your specific concerns/situation and give you personal advice/guidance rather than something that could apply to just anyone. It was a very interesting class for me, and I enjoyed the experience. I would highly recommend taking it.
Hi, I’m taking this class rn and I’m just wondering how easy it is to get full points on the quizzes and discussion assignments cuz I just noticed there’s only a 30 pt range for an A? Thanks!
I remembered the quizzes were really tricky, and I did not get full points on them. But there is no need to worry, because you can achieve nearly full points on all other categories (which take about 80% of the grade if my memory is correct) if you show your effort and follow the basic guidelines. Because quizzes only take about 20% of your grade, it is still manageable to get an A even if you did poorly on quizzes.
Ah thanks! Looks like she changed the format of the class this semester cuz quizzes are now more than 50% of the grade and they are quite tricky"
