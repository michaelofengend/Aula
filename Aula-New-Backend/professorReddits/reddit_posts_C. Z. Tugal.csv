Autism in Women and University Life - Looking for Research Participants!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1c1oixr/autism_in_women_and_university_life_looking_for/,2024-04-11 12:56:09,"Hello, I am sociology undergraduate and am currently doing a research project **on the experiences of autistic women in university, both clinically and self-diagnosed.** I have been having some trouble finding more participants for this study, which is why I decided to make this post.

This project is part of my SOC 108 research seminar course, and involves conducting one in-depth interview with participants to get a detailed understanding of their life. I chose this topic for my research project because I think there is a lack of research on women with autism during the university stage of life, and this research is necessary to create better resources for them. If you would like more detail on this project, please feel free to message me or click on the Google form link below. And of course, thank you for reading :)

welcome to cal
A large percentage of students get an A or A+ in 61A every semester. If you don’t mess around you’ll be fine.
The grading scheme has always been like this iirc. You get around 10 points of leeway though through EC
Lotta EC, but yep still very hard
there’s usually 10 pts of extra credit too
That's not terrible -- definitely not great by any means, but the projects are not hard to get full points on, and so all you have to do is study hard for the exams and you'll do fine! IMO it's really annoying that discussions are worth points though bc honestly this is college, you are paying to be here, if you don't want to attend something that should be up to you. 

Study up, do well on the exams (you've got a clobber policy to help you out if you mess up), and you'll be fine!
Presumably lab, discussion, homework and the projects will all be guaranteed to count for full credit, maybe even with opportunities for extra credit, as long as you put in the time to finish them. Full credit there would leave you needing a 150/160 on the tests combined (+ any extra credit). With the help of the clobber policy, that’s not exactly easy but it is doable
It seems really hard but it def is possible. You have to give it a lottt of time though
this is how it always has been. welcome to Cal
Is it always like this?
45% of the grade you can pretty easily get max points by doing all your non-test assignments with some effort.  It’s also based out of 310 and not 300 as there will be some bonus points, which you won’t want to miss out on.  Roughly 20% maybe even 25% of students for a given semester get an A or above.
How come the points only add up to 294 but it says it’s graded out of 300
Monta Vista High School
I'm not sure why Cal does this. Most private schools on the same level have grade inflation so Cal students have a severe disadvantage when they apply for graduate school. Consider this is a summer course, 30% of the class will be international students who have already taken the class. Maybe this is why Cal's alumni donation and participation is so low. Why hurt your own students for a better career opportunity?
The threshold for an A will decrease and there is extra credit that is easy to get, but it's still really hard
Grade deflation
So it’s easier to get C’s and B’s. Wow
I just got in yesterday. Since I need a good grade to declare, I’ll probably drop and take in the fall.
And what difference does it make if you get an A?
Its always been like that. I got a 299/300 in Fa22 it is possible— I know
It was the same bin in my sem and a friend and I got As. These bins are kinda misleading cause we got a ton of extra credit. 10 points or something IIRC for attending discussions and submitting assignments early and stuff. 

If you get all those extra credit points, you need 280/300 to get an A, which is 93.3%, and 93% is usually the cutoff for an A anyways.
The projects, homework’s, and labs make up about 50% of grade and are practically free points. So basically you need a 93% on tests, which is normal A range and you also have extra credit. Nothing is easy at berkeley, but an A is definitely doable
Good ol’ Cal.
very possible lol
Yeah this is normal. So, I assume there are 6 extra credit points?

To be fair when I did it the syllabus added up to 300 points and we had 10 extra credit points, a clobber, and only 150 points were based on tests, rather than 160.
> there are no easy As at Cal

Depends on your aptitude obviously but there are plenty of classes where as long as you show up and complete the work you can easily get an A
What is clobber
This is the problem with UC culture in general.  It really hurts students.  There's a reason Cal alumni are not the highest paid, their gpas make them look bad.
[deleted]
Is it a 97 for an A every semester?
If you choose the mega section you get automatically full discussion credit without ever having to attend anything
Is it 150/160 or 156/160? Total points is only 294
there's about 10 points of extra credit throughout the semester
Citation needed on Berkeley students not getting into grad school since empirically it's not true at all. Berkeley has super grade inflation too, just not quite to the actual insanity that goes on at the school across the bay. It's certainly way easier now than it was a decade ago in the same classes. The averages for classes are almost consistently at a B+ even 61A nowadays. You don't even need to be that good to get all A/B in your classes.
I've never heard of a bin shift in 61A. They make it a point to mention in the syllabus that the cutoffs will not change under any circumstance. I've seen it happen in 61B though.
it’s the same thing for fall most likely but yeah it does give you more time to study
Some people still need a 3.3 to declare and GPA matters to people too
GPA?
And tbh 61A falls under this to. Most of the points in the class you get full credit for just by doing your work. You don't actually need great exam scores for the A.
recovering points for doing good on the final
Just checked past semester syllabus it’s always around a 97 for an A
[deleted]
Oh true. Says 300 above and I trusted it. Maybe one of the values is off or maybe 6 are from some unlisted source
Every past syllabus I’ve looked at adds up to 300 points though. That would mean this summer is like twice as strict for the A cutoff as 61a has been historically
berkeley doesn’t have grade inflation?
I got bin shifted fall 23 by a point or two (not rounding)
They binshift by adding pts to exam scores.
There was a bin shift when I took it in spring 2022.
Yup! Not trying to cram everything in 8 weeks.
yes you do need great exam scores for the A… what are you talking about lmao
...according to the provided points distribution, you can miss *five total points all term* and not get the A without extra credit. 

IDK what to tell you, but 155/160 combined on the midterm and final would absolutely be a ""great"" set of exam scores.
on Berkeley time the grade bins for summer for A+/A usually beat the fall/spring semesters
Welp. Good luck to me taking it online this summer with no prior programming experience 🙏
Seems kind of dumb.  It's so few points that slight random mistakes can make or break it introducing a significant component of random luck.
Istg it better be a mistake. I don’t want to have to drop but only 4 points of leeway excluding extra credit would be kinda ridiculous, especially since it looks like it’s never been that strict before. Past syllabi have actually added up to 300
we absolutely do, average GPAs have increased quite a bit (esp for CS) over the last 10 years

edit: https://pages.github.berkeley.edu/OPA/our-berkeley/gpa-by-major.html for data. admittedly, CS and stats (my two majors) inflated significantly, changes elsewhere are a lot smaller. This might also reverse course once the COVID years are no longer being counted.
They specifically say on this syllabus that despite doing so in previous semesters, the threshold will not be adjusted based on student performance
If you do your work and get the essentially free points and EC all you need is like \~90% on the exams. That's lower than is expected for probably most classes at Berkeley. It's why tons and tons of students get As every term without issue.
Five total points? 290 is 10 less than 300…
You forgot about the generous extra credit in 61A, usually given out just for turning in your work a little early. If you get those you only need on average \~90% on the exams to get an A. That's not a difficult threshold and a large percentage of students every term make it and then some.
Unless you have some other reason to be confident in your performance, I recommend dropping the class ASAP. CS61A is not an intro level course and the instructors always try to get students to understand this. Take CS10 instead and statistically you will get a much better grade in CS61A. It is on you to be prepared for classes at Berkeley.
There is no random luck. If you've taken the class you'll know that most of the points in 61A you can get just by doing the work. All projects, labs, and discussions can be completed for guaranteed full credit if you pass the autograder. This is not to mention the generous extra credit. If you do your work you only need not horrible grades on the exams to get an A.
Yeah I’d be very surprised if they only offered 294 with 290 as the max
berkeley literally does not have grade inflation in any fashion. the average gpa for graduates has gotten higher because there’s now a gpa cutoff so it’s harder to graduate with a low gpa so everyone for the most part is graduating with a higher gpa. please define grade inflation for me because Cal has one of the worst curves out of any school so i’m curious who has grade deflation in your mind then.
I mean tbf couldn’t that also be because it’s gotten so much harder to get in that the caliber of students might be higher
they always say that lol
Wow yeah, if there are 10 EC points you actually only need an 87.5 exam average. That makes me feel better
bro getting a little above avg on exams only net you b/b+ you def have to do great on exams to get an A
Did I add up the points offered for assignments incorrectly? 

64+96+100+14+10+10=294?

Edit: it is very confusing that the assignments add to 294 but the course is graded out of 300.
I didn't forget about the extra credit (I literally included the clause ""without extra credit"") and I hear your point.
I’m an incoming transfer so if I want to declare I need to take this, 61B, and 70 all by summer 24. Honestly I’ve looked at some of the past exams and they don’t seem too bad… it seems like the most important thing is a good grasp of logic rather than necessarily prior coding experience. Like the questions on the exam seem like logic problems. I was able to figure a good amount of them out

And I’m not going on vacation or anything so I can dedicate time to grind
Ah, ok.  Never took the class (just did grad work here).  In most classes, though, for exams there's always some element of 'forgetting a sign flip' doing a math derivation, or missing an edge case in a coding exercise, or not stating the logic clearly enough in the step of a proof where you can lose a point here or there.  Things that even if you know the material 100%, you might lose out on.  But maybe that's not how they grade it with 61a.
Highlighting the larger majors:

average GPA of L&S CS graduates has increased from 3.21 in 2012-13 to 3.64 in 2021-2022. EECS from 3.27 to 3.60. Statistics from 3.26 to 3.67. Applied math from 3.29 to 3.48. Economics 3.46 to 3.59. Integrative bio from 3.27 to 3.37. business administration (haas) from 3.51 to 3.66.

admittedly, I think my perspective is biased because both of my majors inflated significantly, while other majors had minor increases that are probably attributable to COVID policies (and will likely reverse).

data: https://pages.github.berkeley.edu/OPA/our-berkeley/gpa-by-major.html

also, the definition of inflation is an increase in prices. having lower inflation than other countries doesn't mean your country doesn't have inflation. I'd imagine the same definition applies to grade inflation?
that could be a reason for grade inflation but doesn't mean there isn't grade inflation.

also, funnily enough, people here don't seem to make the same argument for schools like harvard :P
I’ve looked at past syllabi and it doesn’t say that. It says they may bin shift but they want to avoid it. On this syllabus it specifically says they will not bin shift even though they have before
Huh I didn’t add them up… that’s really weird. I guess there’s just 6 points of leeway? 

EDIT: wait a second no, that’d be like negative leeway lmao. Is the max grade possible 294/300? How does that work?
I was a transfer in the fall with years of coding experience and with grinding and studying nonstop I barely got an A-. I would NOT recommend taking 61A with no prior programming experience as well.
That’s good then. It’s only a trend that people with experience do better, but only you can know if you’re ready for the class. If you do some prestudying and the exams look doable to you as you say, then plenty of people have succeeded in your shoes.
you're completely right. being good at math helps more with 61a than having a lot of programming experience.

(it's not a math class obviously, but it involves the same kind of logical thinking.)
again, this is because they implemented a 3.3 GPa cutoff in the first 3 classes so it wasn’t really inflated in CS as it is people with higher GPAs getting into the major. Not sure about other majors but that is why L&S averages went up. You don’t understand what grade inflation is because it’s not about the change from year to year but rather about the standard curve applied to a class in comparison to other schools. While most other schools actually inflate grades by giving a higher percentage a higher grade than otherwise would, Cal often does the opposite. In this instance, you need a 97 to get an A which is deflation compared to the standard scale. Obviously not all classes are deflated but when it is a common practice, that school is considered to have grade deflation
sounds like a skill issue
EECS went up just as much taking the same classes dude. I've noticed personally that grade distributions got nicer comparing my freshman year or the year before to my senior year.

and what you're saying makes absolutely zero sense. the absolute percentage to get a certain grade makes no difference at all because it varies by class, in most stem classes there is no ""standard scale."" you can get an A in most cs classes averaging 65-70% on exams, is that an example of intense grade inflation?

grade inflation is entirely determined by the grade distribution. average GPAs increasing over time is evidence that grade distributions have gotten nicer and that grade inflation is occurring.
good read for you: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_inflation
all the major classes i’ve taken at Cal so far give about 10-20% As besides 61b. Would not describe that as lenient and have not seen anywhere else nearly as harsh.
what the actual god-loving fuck does 

> higher grade than students deserve

mean? I feel the second part of the definition

> yields a higher average grade given to students

is the operative part of that definition. when you give a higher **grade** to students on **average**, the **grade** point **average** goes up.
literally no CS class gives <18% As. many are in the 30-40% range.
Read the whole thing: “However, higher average grades in themselves do not prove grade inflation”
Those are upper division classes. 61A was around 20 last semester. My math course was at 11%…"

The new scheduling model guarantees we will play every ACC team at least twice every seven years. 2025, we will host UNC, Duke, SMU and Virginia, and play at Boston College, Louisville, Furd and Virginia Tech.
Just started PhD at Georgia tech and am disappointed
I like it. The schedule in the ACC should be a bit easier on average and we get one more out of conference game. We should schedule a winnable but not cupcake game (teams like Nevada, Rice, etc) in that spot. If Cal Athletics wants to survive longer than the next 8 years or so the football teams needs to go from a 4-6 win team to an 8-10 win team. Half of that can come from the schedule, the other half has to come from better coaching and recruiting.
Is the Big Game really in September?
Need AD and admins to care enough about football to get us into the Big Ten in the next round of realignment
I actually wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of out of town fans travel to these games @ Cal since they’re so infrequent. I met a lot of Auburn fans who flew in for the game and spent the rest of the time hanging out in California. Which in some ways is arguably better for Cal than having a lot of rival fans just BART over from SF or Oakland.
Also, if Cal really cares about attendance, they should start finding ways to get Cal fans in the stands. Games just aren’t as fun when half the fans there are rooting for the opposing team in your home stadium.
Miami is a bigger football brand than UCLA
Who said it’s september? This isn’t in order
Both the Auburn and SC games were hella fun this year and had the most visiting fans
Yeah, but how many people are likely to travel from FL to CA for a football game? At least for UCLA and USC, it's only a 6 hour drive vs a 6 hour flight for Miami
A ton. The away section was sold out we played Auburn, a school from Alabama. Miami is arguably a bigger football brand than UCLA and is in the SEC, so I think they’re willing to travel.
There's a huge UCLA alumni base in the bay. A bunch of UCLA students also make the trip when we play them...

We played Miami in a bowl game in SF - barely any Miami fans."

**Context:**  
This week, transit agency boards are weighing in on whether to support integrated transit fares.  [Integrated fares](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/atcYNHk4Eh2YdGnwBh-YDPBC_2qPv7WKfzKLXVjCZKzk0-OeU4pYT66WrxEcToe294raIOxPT3BPrq4Vd7-QCMQco9EQfSoJw4LLRmBf5gLCl4jZ27J71By-cYsCmNgr8aBkRH2lhk5IBnZ6jb2e2MiaYcyxc1Bcy0bG3U7QnyWpKsSAyJ-TpWg8nKQ8hmaBA9HNQZ6Jk8GpUsYckVMvWf-I4p_GG_kJQpeSG2oA59V0o4VLI_Pq4NRZ_MTyeiq6yhq6zMEue3cqbVZM4uDpGjjZtzKLi9qwGKDFd8UoUQmt4-VRGOMxjgcssqay5JFhbzhkFSaCORIpTAsw7FrWpQfb3xwNpBcGLdWZOm7uAYi1QBlFHeWEJEE0ysE9dwPP8tFoQi1PLHUrwHKYb2BdHTc1iZedsHY2Swt_zZcob1o/3g2/S8daIensQryPPYcYcWxSPA/h0/jWPg0KLHMl2zNjWH6NmPZ-QXi4bgzVY6bQdeyK7RHUY) are not only a critical part of a rider-first, seamless transit system but also a cost-effective policy that could help to bring riders back many more riders to transit.

BART’s weekday ridership has been running below 30% and AC Transit local ridership is still less than 50% of pre-Covid levels.

Making transfers free between agencies could add over 25,000 riders, a similar scale as flagship bus routes such as the AC Transit 51 lines; or both downtown Oakland stations together. And standardizing regional fares (BART, Caltrain, ferry, express bus) could help add about 69,000 riders, as many riders as another pre-Covid Caltrain.

As the pandemic eases and people adapt to new travel patterns, the regional fare [study](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/tTBUZwcBH_2q13Ow12s-jckP20jWxBj3X4ev8eQSSIy3xELxy-gwghDjaXnqwIlt1qc3-WUcQbb24tZriw_aWbyJoUJH6uXe1zg_DTjXPrYzjCxFA68r3_dgQ_4PgdWuZX-4Fv-CnxgCvpJUmCDpDOH8BsRE0mmFFIqW4x5Xa-Xr5AiHQPENnkbLTmIYNV0ncpt92PVAe6sCNVmPGFotL8Ss1VTJ0zup3Kj-uAjfGmGOTef3McbcqujAVJET3_ZbywB9I_DRIntv2b8JFwchLDeYUUroqZCfTS8QovIsKXtPZnzUpJ-RDuN7KJeDNLRO37H1NBbUETzBXDEETxDLBgtCG7tEXrh5FYO-pY3LljrheBQZVj07kMy7XtvtNZlElvV4hBeeO49UqauFVGfJKJKeLBZmpae1Os01vHgjQqPeVvgak7XLnbOf6YRAXqUnz-2HaDgBKINjVM1ZYnjTOQ/3g2/S8daIensQryPPYcYcWxSPA/h1/BtYecKJOsAwSQvloNA6OUZ_n3J6wtmqo31VeV35x8p4) shows that fare integration can be a powerful strategy to restore transit ridership by making transit more convenient, attracting new riders and new trips.

**What the hell does this mean for Cal?**   
The Campus relies on both AC Transit and BART (as well as others such as SolanoExpress, WestCAT, and MUNI) to commute to the campus. Many students and employees have asked for integrated or discount fares to get around; however, it's rather difficult since Parking & Transportation is a self-funded unit and can only provide as many programs as budgeted (P&T pays out \~$4million annually to AC Transit, the higher education discount through BART would be estimated at  $800K to $1.4 million annually)  


As the development of the campus' master plan and Long Range Development Plan takes shape, as well as a ballot measure to renew the Class Pass in 2023, the campus stands to not only lose parking spaces, [but use this as an opportunity also be partners with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission to improve the Clipper Card program](https://mtc.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=878224&GUID=69137C12-A9E3-4ACD-A51A-A9BE55274CDB&link_id=1&can_id=2a9949098c82f89a28e849287240afb5&source=email-this-coming-week-support-seamless-fares-at-sfmta-samtrans-caltrain-ac-transit-bart-2&email_referrer=email_1320093&email_subject=this-week-support-seamless-fares-at-ac-transit-and-bart) by support institutional passes such as EasyPass. It would be also important as we evolve in a post-pandemic world that  the campus, along with the region and state, get serious about environmental impacts due to increased driving and congestion. For students, this means expanded access to jobs and social events in SF, Silicon Valley, and beyond.",
Are y’all getting notifications that other Berkeley students are using this? What do u think of it?,https://i.redd.it/njtsmuh20pec1.jpeg,2024-01-25 18:06:40,,"i had it and then deleted it bc it’s basically the same as the official school discord but more annoying to use

I used it and found good housemates so it’s pretty good

Paying it forward. AMA!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fqd7fu/paying_it_forward_ama/,2020-03-27 21:21:23,"**A bit long, but TLDR at the end!**

Four years ago, I was exactly where a lot of you are right now -- with a hodgepodge of college acceptances and rejections and about a month to decide where to spend the next chapter of my life. The decision was immense, but one thing stood between me and total darkness:

**This complete stranger on Facebook.**

See, you know that feeling when you know so *little* about something you don't even know where to start asking questions? That was me pretty much my second semester senior year in high school. I didn't understand how to enroll in classes. I didn't know how to apply for financial aid. I didn't even get the process of declaring a major. **""What do you mean you can't major in 'pre-med'?""**

It wasn't until I stumbled upon the admit Facebook page until I saw a glimmer of hope. This random stranger, a graduating senior no less, was answering *every question* one could ever hope to ask. ""How big are class sizes?"" ""Can you double major in different colleges?"" ""I'm interested in doing research with Professors X, Y, and Z, but I only have experience with A, B,  and C. How should I email them?"" She was honest. She was detailed. Above all, she was understanding.

And in my time of need, that was exactly what I was looking for -- someone who understood that I was going through this period of uncertainty and gave me whatever information I needed to make an educated decision. I never got to ask her a question myself, but reading through her answers gave me an incredible peace of mind.

So in the interests of paying it forward, I thought I'd do something similar and hold an AMA! **Here are some things you may want to know about me:**

* I'm majoring in Public Health. I'm also minoring in Public Policy. 
* I was a GBO leader my second-year, so hit me up if you want ice breaker ideas.
* I was a GBO leader for *transfer students*, so I can try to answer any transfer-specific questions, too.

And, finally, much to my surprise four years later:

* I'm pre-med.

So comment below with your questions or PM me! If your question is out of my expertise, I'll try to reach out to someone else who may know more than I do. Whatever the case may be, your questions are valid, and I'd like to help any way I can!

**TLDR: I'm majoring in Public Health and minoring in Public Policy. I'm also pre-med. AMA!**","The hero we don’t deserve

When do you think we'll have a vaccine for covid-19?
Have you been able to do research at Berkeley, or was it too competitive? Can you do research as a freshman? 

Is pre-med at UC Berkeley as cut-throat as they say? I've heard horror stories lol
Good question! I'm certainly not qualified to answer this question by myself, but I can refer you to a Q&A session about COVID-19 hosted by Berkeley Public Health earlier this week. It sounds like it's possible that a vaccine be developed within 12 to 18 months. However, this would be a best case scenario because any candidate vaccine would need to undergo thorough tests to ensure its safety and effectiveness.

Not OP but you can absolutely do research here. I started research my sophomore year and haven't stopped since (senior now). You can do research as a freshman if you want- there's nothing stopping you. 

>Is pre-med at UC Berkeley as cut-throat as they say?

People say it's competitive but I really haven't encountered this. Most students are very welcoming and open to collaboration. The classes are definitely hard, but you can absolutely get A's in them if you put in the work.
I definitely agree! I would say getting a research position is really a matter of persistence -- in the form of **a lot** of cold emailing -- and also a certain element of luck. However, it gets easier over time as you start to develop relationships with your professors, build your network, and put yourself out there. I would start looking for opportunities early on because you never know what might come up. However, I would also urge you to not get discouraged if you don't find something your very first semester or year.

As for the competitiveness, I think pre-meds are naturally a neurotic bunch. I'm certainly no exception. And while there are always going to be students who try to do everything to get ahead, I think one of the main benefits of going to such a big school like Berkeley is that you're bound find a community that supports you through your time here!"
"Shit Cal Students Say: The backlash to Andrew Kooker's insensitive comments - oh wait, actually he was right all along and how dare Student Action drop him for expressing his brave and correct viewpoints?!?!",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rlbjj/shit_cal_students_say_the_backlash_to_andrew/,2012-03-30 12:09:22,"A couple days ago a [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rh994/student_action_candidate_andrew_kooker_dropped/) was submitted to this subreddit linking to a Daily Cal article about Student Action's decision to drop Andrew Kooker from their Senate slate in response to some [some](http://i.imgur.com/RnBc2.jpg) [insensitive](http://i.imgur.com/a2Yel.png) [comments](http://i.imgur.com/CDv7k.jpg) claiming that non-engineering/hard science/business majors are wasting their time, money, and effort by going to Cal and majoring in things that will be useless to them post-graduation, among other things (shout-out to CNR, what what).

Given the response on Reddit was mostly agreeing that Andrew Kooker was indeed in the wrong, I expected the comments on the Daily Cal article to be similar in spirit...

NOPE!

So yeah... I'm just really upset after reading all these comments to be an Engineering major at what I thought was a great school with a great community.","The Daily Cal comments section is not an accurate representation of the Cal community.  I bet most people on campus have no idea who Andrew Kooker is, or care what he has to say.
I'm confused, didn't he resign? What's all this about protecting free speech?
who?
There will always be a very overvocal minority waiting to get butthurt over anything.
I place ""taking a huge shit"" higher than ""Daily Cal comments"" on my ""Things I Deem Appropriate for Conversation with People"" list.

You would do well to take a similar approach.
I always feel that some ""liberal"" outlets like the Daily Cal or some SF news sites, the comment section attracts some very conservative or trolly crowds. 
In which [/r/berkeley](/r/berkeley) is introduced to the [effort post]. I like it, but I'd let SRS keep the poop-speak.
The Daily Cal comments section is where trolls come out to play, just roll your eyes and move on.
People who foolishly think their degree is useless really need to stop feeling sorry for themselves and do something to change their ""fate"". 
You thought UCB had a great community? What are you a freshmen? It sounds to me like Kooker is just representing the exact views of the the university administration and what they've been for years. Honestly, I'm surprised there even still are any liberal arts at Cal. 
The Daily Cal comment section is full of trolls, much like any other comment section of a newspaper (check out CNN or Fox's comment section and you'll see the same thing).  
would you say thats a good or bad thing?
Student Action took him off the slate but is keeping him around because he ""shows promise"".  He'll be back at some point in the future.
care to explain?
I wouldn't say it's good or bad.  I don't think what he did hurt anyone but himself.
It's good in the sense that his screw-ups don't cost him as much now as they will when/if he becomes a career politician.  It's fairly painless for him to discover now that it's best to keep your contempt for the people who elect you to yourself.
But he was the one who resigned, right?
Engineering departments haven't had their budgets cut as much, I don't think. (this is vaguely remembered from a Daily Cal editorial a few years ago)

I'm guessing that's what he's talking about.
Dunno, I just remember seeing something about SA issuing a statement about him being off the ticket but still in the party.  I'm not at Cal anymore, so I don't keep up with these things so much.
Yeah, I'm not sure how true that is.  I know they had to combine two of the ChemE lab classes into one a few years to save money (I was actually the last class that had the opportunity to take both, which was worth it because those classes are probably the most informative ones).  I was under the impression that budget cuts have affected every department pretty equally.  It might be that more money goes to engineering because the costs are higher.
I don't think many of us here even do"
