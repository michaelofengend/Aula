There's absolutely no good reason to live in Michigan for any extended amount of time unless you have family there. It's just not a pleasant place especially compared to California. COL is low there for a reason, it's a sad place to spend your 20s.

Yeah, but then you have to live Ann Arbor Michigan.
Michigan has an absolutely enormous endowment, only beaten by the major private universities (and Penn, apparently).  They weathered the recession without any issue, and were able to keep raising salaries and hiring fairly aggressively.  Over the next 10 to 20 years, I think they'll consistently keep moving up in ranking.

Definitely an outlier. 
I'm happy profs are making that much. Good for them.
It's called a sunshine tax. 
Respectfully, you are waaaaay off base...

Ann Arbor is incredibly shitty in the summer too.  Average of 80+ degrees with high humidity and 3.5 inches of rain during Jun-Aug.

(I am from the midwest.  Living through snow storms is a pain in the ass. But summer heat+humidity is hell.)
it's not that bad.. i grew up not too far from ann arbor and have been there several times. michigan is a beautiful state.

the fact is, michigan is an incredibly well funded university. props to them paying well.
> compared to California

have you spent much time in the central valley XD
Penn is private
If you think Ann Arbor is ""incredibly shitty"" you probably should avoid everything south of Chicago and east of the Rockies/West Texas

For most of the midwest/south/east coast, summer highs in the low 80s would be a welcome cool-off.

When I think of ""bleh"" weather I think of cold, grey skies, trudging through snow with 10 layers of clothing on, and when the sun does peak out it just reflects off ice-covered surfaces to blind you while biking/driving
bay area weather spoils me
oh shit ur right
Well, that 80s is the average. It's pretty hot most days. 

Ann arbor may be a great town. But muggy summers are my arch enemy, and I don't think people consider them enough when complaining about cold weather. 
> Well, that 80s is the average.

your link suggests otherwise
That is the average daily high. The daily high is the number you say when people ask ""what's the temperature going to be today?"".

The mean is a different metric that takes in account the entire 24h day. I don't know what that number is for my own climate, let alone how to interpret it- and I doubt more than a very few others actually do. 


my point was that low 80s being the average daily high is still cooler than a lot of the country that also has humidity in the summer
> is still cooler than a lot of the country that also has humidity in the summer

Just because it's worse in a lot of the country (even most of it), does not mean it's OK there.

The point is, it's miserable in the winter, and miserable in the summer.  Like much of the upper midwest and Northeast.  (New England in a hot summer is fucking unbearable).

I do concede that warm summer evenings are quite nice; so if you are going to end up in a cubicle all day with A/C, it's not the worst thing.
A lot of the country sucks
 
i guess we just have different takes on what is miserable"
New Changes being made to Counseling and Psychological Services,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14mh7ge/new_changes_being_made_to_counseling_and/,2023-06-29 14:32:56,"Dear Campus Community,
 
The UC Board of Regents today voted to establish the Virtual Reality(VR) center and include it as part of the Counseling and Psychological services.
 
The college will provide a realistic, high-quality, and ethics-oriented Virtual Waifu & Femboy experience to a diverse student body in stressful, high-impact majors such as CS and EECS. It will also enable faculty to conduct groundbreaking, multidisciplinary research that capitalizes on Berkeley’s excellence across campus. 
 
The founding units of the new revolutionary program include the Department of Statistics, the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (jointly with the College of Engineering), the Data Science Undergraduate Studies program, the Center for Computational Biology, the Computational Precision Health program (jointly with UCSF), the Bakar Institute of Digital Materials for the Planet, D-Lab – the Social Science Data Lab (jointly with the Social Sciences Division) and the Berkeley Institute for Data Science. 
 
We are thrilled to announce this new program at Berkeley, one that connects our excellent research and education in computing, data science and psychology with the need to help our hard-working stressed students. Infusing the power of Virtual Reality and its applications to the realm of psychology and human behavior will help us to fully realize the potential of waifus and femboys to benefit society, help address our world’s most challenging problems and achieve our most visionary goals. 
 
At Berkeley, we have both the opportunity and responsibility to educate our students from diverse backgrounds to become the ethical leaders we need in this sphere, whether they pursue careers in industry, the public sector or education. You can read more about the college on Berkeley News. 
 
We’d like to take this moment to thank and congratulate the countless individuals who worked for years to make this day possible. We are especially grateful to the many generous donors who have made this dream a reality. Additionally, we’d like to thank u/Cal_Aesthetics_Club for presenting us with the unprecedented and ambitious idea.
 
For over 150 years, Berkeley has been empowering engaged thinkers and global citizens to change our world. The creation of this program is a testament to the fact that we continue to innovate to prepare students today to solve the challenges of tomorrow.

Update on planning for the fall semester,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gettt4/update_on_planning_for_the_fall_semester/,2020-05-06 15:12:53,"Just sent to students, faculty, and staff:

\##

Dear faculty, staff and students,

We are writing today to provide an update on our ongoing planning for fall semester operations. The planning process is wide-ranging and is deepening every day as we bring more faculty and staff onto the committees (described below) that are helping us envision what the fall term could look like. We aim to make key decisions in regard to fall operations by mid-June.

**Guiding Principle**

A single principle guides all of this work: **to protect the** **health of our community**. There are additional sets of principles that guide our plans for instruction and research. We are committed to upholding Berkeley’s excellence across all of our mission areas.

**Scenario Planning**

Because we don’t know what the spread of COVID-19 will look like over the course of the next few months, each committee below has been asked to develop plans for each of the following three scenarios for the fall semester:

* **Scenario #1:** For public health reasons, the campus must continue with **full remote** instruction, and predominantly remote work being done in the operations and research realms.
* **Scenario #2**: **In-person** operations resume, **with limits** and restrictions imposed by public health authorities.
* **Scenario #3**: Campus operations largely **return** **to normal** (i.e., mostly in-person), but wherever possible, will accommodate students, staff, researchers and instructors who need or prefer to operate remotely due to continuing pandemic conditions.

**Committees**

Each of the following committees has been charged with studying and making suggestions for a key area of campus operations. Each committee will be led by members of the [Chancellor’s Cabinet](https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/about-office/chancellors-cabinet) and special advisors who will share their committees’ progress and recommendations during weekly Cabinet meetings. The Cabinet will use the recommendations to guide decision-making as we develop plans to resume operations in a way that maximizes community safety.  In addition, we will look for opportunities to incorporate the broad range of student perspectives. 

The current committees are:

1. **COVID-19 Public Health and Testing Advisory** **Committee.** Led by Nicholas Jewell, professor of biostatistics in the School of Public Health.
2. **Research**. Led by Vice Chancellor for Research Randy Katz.
3. **Instruction**. Led by Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Paul Alivisatos.
4. **Student Engagement and Services**. Co-led by Vice Provost for Graduate Studies Lisa Garcia Bedolla, Vice Chancellor for Equity and Inclusion Oscar Dubón, Vice Chancellor for Undergraduate Education Cathy Koshland, and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Stephen Sutton.
5. **Housing and Dining**. Led by Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Stephen Sutton.
6. **Operations**. Led by Vice Chancellor for Administration Marc Fisher. There are three subcommittees within the Operations working group: Workforce, led by Vice Provost for the Faculty Benjamin Hermalin and Chief People and Culture Officer Eugene Whitlock; Events and External Relations; and Information Technology, led by Jenn Stringer.
7. **Athletics**. Led by Director of Athletics James Knowlton.
8. **Financial Planning**. Led by Vice Chancellor for Finance Rosemarie Rae.
9. **Communications**. Led by Associate Vice Chancellor for Communications and Public Affairs Diana Harvey.

Again, all of this planning is being done with public health guidelines as our backdrop. We will proceed only with the guidance and express approval of local public health authorities.

We will continue to provide regular status reports about this critical planning process on the campus [COVID-19 website](https://news.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/), under the Return to Campus tab. In addition, our next [Campus Conversations](https://campusconversations.berkeley.edu/) event on Monday, April 12 will feature Chancellor Christ, and we [invite you to submit questions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfaeOwW_QfTa7aTkwtcgeHcH181ohlmZy9lbgW-7n0BDEGrew/viewform) about the plans and structures we have established here. We’ll make every effort to address your inquiries on Monday’s webcast.

Thank you for everything you are doing to support the university’s mission and serve our students. It is indeed a challenging and uncertain time, and we have been so grateful for your commitment, as well as your patience and flexibility. What makes Berkeley *Berkeley* is not just our physical campus, or our history, or our traditions… above all else, it is our community. No matter what our fall semester looks like, we will remain strong because of the dedicated service of so many of you.","At some point, a definitive decision has to be made, regardless of the ambiguity of trusted pandemic projections. Although these committees are certainly doing well by preparing for these various scenarios, let’s not forget that this is the institution preparing ITSELF for the Fall. 

Students are still in the same situation, and completely unaware of what Fall will bring, and many are considering withdrawing, staying home, etc., and are facing a wide array of difficulties from both the unresponsiveness of the administration and the community function. 

Other academic institutions in CA have declared their Fall policy. Berkeley should too, considering it’s an international hub in the Bay Area, there can’t be any more people left in the dark about this.

Um did y’all forget to proof read? It’s already May lol

Are these people seriously considering a *normal* fall semester after March 10?
The goal is to have final decisions on the major elements by mid-June. Let me know which areas you're referring to re unresponsiveness? I can try to help. We're moving as quickly as we can given the magnitude of the decisions and the changing public health landscape and guidance.
Eep, evidently. It's this coming Monday (...the 11th) at noon. I honestly don't know how we got the month *and* day wrong. We're sending another short message out on Friday so at least it'll clarify things.
Not saying that it is more likely, but from what I have heard about ""hybrid,"" I think it is #2, where let's say big CS lectures are online but small studio classes and really necessary labs offer the in person option.
I think people are worried mostly about housing. It would be hard to find housing now, let alone mid June
can we please get a specific date? Some of us have potential leases in the air and would like to decide whether or not to sign them asap. Having a specific date allows us to negotiate with our landlords as there'll be a clear deadline for us to make our decision by.
Can you please clarify if an online option will be offered regardless of what happens? As a non traditional student at a much higher health risk this is gravely important to me. In one e-mail it was announced it would be guaranteed, whereas this e-mail doesn't seem to hold this promise (i.e, I can't imagine with scenario 3 professors would abide to an online format if it wasn't required and some people were going to class in person)
To emphasize housing concerns on a financial level: 

We are guaranteed an online option, and a question mark for in person. Given that many leases end in May and people need to renew *right now*, the financially secure option is to cancel your lease, because 

a) the semester is fully online, and you save on the rent + 
b) the semester is also in person, in which you would miss out on in-person classes (if you can't find last minute housing), but would still get to work towards your degree

But if you plan for in-person courses, you take on **significant** risks. You take on financial risk of an entire year of rent, and if you are unable to find roommates (of which many are too scared to commit to a full year of rent for the same reasons), or end up with roommates who would rather take the smaller financial hit of cancelling their part of the lease come Fall, then you're really in deep for it now. Coupled with the fact that college students are really, really bad at communicating negative risks until the last minute, and it's a sizable fear for a lot of people.

---

Edit: I don't know how the UC would be able to help with this by releasing any plans earlier. Many leases have 90 day move out clauses, meaning a lot of people have already made the decision to stay or go. I am curious to see if on-campus population for Fall 2020 has already met its fate and been locked in by this point in time.
Wouldn’t it be easier right now? I would have thought the lack of students would have made things alit cheaper.
This from the provost's office: All indications at this point are that there will be an online option for all or nearly all classes to accommodate those who cannot obtain visas as well as students and instructors who may be at elevated risk.
True
I think its mostly because of contracts and subleasing hassles? Pretty confusing times rn
Which scenario are you all leaning towards right now?
Thank you!!
Interesting. I would have thought demand was super low."
