There's a famous sex-trafficking cult leader at Berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/isw5fd/theres_a_famous_sextrafficking_cult_leader_at/,2020-09-14 15:51:25,"(Posting this from a throwaway because this person potentially has my contact information and posts on my main could be used to identify me. Also as a disclaimer I'm not trying to start a witch hunt here but she's a public figure and I think people should know about this so that they don't share personal info that they wouldn't want a sex-trafficking cult leader to have.)

Allison Mack of Smallville and NXIVM sex cult fame, who used women's sensitive personal information to blackmail them into sexual slavery, is now a student at Berkeley. She's a new transfer student which means she was admitted with all of the charges against her being public knowledge. She was in my ""Gender, Sex and Power"" class for about a week, but left voluntarily after outcry from students who did not feel safe discussing those topics with someone who branded other women. As far as I know she is still a student at Berkeley, but I don't know what other classes she is taking this semester. Our professor will not tell us how the administration is handling this matter being brought to their attention due to privacy laws. It is not widely public knowledge that she is a student here, but she is a public figure and I feel morally obligated to let other students know about her presence.

Here's a source for the charges, which she plead guilty to last year but is still awaiting sentencing on. 

[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/nyregion/nxivm-allison-mack.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/nyregion/nxivm-allison-mack.html)

Be careful what info you share in class, and stay safe.","I was also in this class and can confirm. She was also in a “History of Human Rights” course before somebody called her out. Apparently she is a GWS major, but I can’t confirm this. She has a history of targeting feminist authors for her cult, so this is very troubling if true.

EDIT: Added some details.

what the fuck
>She was in my ""Gender, Sex and Power"" class for about a week

Bitch clearly can't read the room.

Gonna start watching the docuseries tonight, now that I'm all caught up on *Lovecraft Country* and *Raised by Wolves.*
As a woman, this makes me really uncomfortable knowing she is a student here.
This is straight up some ""Handmaid's Tale"" shit, who let her enroll here?
This thread naming a student is only allowed because the student also happens to be a well-known public figure.
Another Edit: OP has posted more information in a reply to this comment. It has a lot more information and it's pretty convincing that Mack is definitely attending classes at Cal. Nevertheless, I will still claim that too much of the information about Allison Mack at Berkeley relies on internet rumors and to be careful when finding news. Allison Mack doesn't belong at Berkeley, and if she is enrolled then admissions has a lot to explain.

Previous Edit: Other than students (subreddit members) who have claimed that they've seen Mack in class, I could not find a single news source or other reliable source claiming that she is enrolled at UC Berkeley. For instance, (the following is entirely speculation and I'm only speculating to show how little we know about Mack and Berkeley) Mack didn't plea guilty until July 2019, and she wasn't arrested until April 2018-it is entirely possible that she was accepted to UCB before the full scope of her criminal activities were known (before 2018) and she had delayed enrollment because she was a ""busy actress"". In which case, UCB had did nothing wrong by accepting her application (because back then, Allison Mack was ""a famous actress interested in women empowerment"". Wow, writing that hypocritical statement fills me with disguist). 

You could make similar groundless claims: that Allison Mack isn't even a student and was simply auditing a Berkeley class for some messed-up reason, that Allison Mack is indeed a student and has been attending Berkeley under the alias ""Fucking Angel"" to protect her identity, etc. In any case, there is just too little information and we can't make any assumptions about either Allison Mack or UC Berkeley's role in this until more news comes out. Internet rumors are as legitimate as rumors. They cannot be trusted.

Original Comment:
Holy shit, sure she sounds remorseful but she needs to be in jail. I'm all for forgiving criminals who have learned from their mistakes but what she has done is next-level criminal:

""she began recruiting other women into a secret sect within Nxivm in which women were branded with Mr. Raniere’s initials and were forced to have sex with him"" --> rape. It's called rape.

""Several female journalists also shared that they had received emails from Ms. Mack trying to pitch them on joining a female empowerment organization"" --> FUCKING DECEITFUL WHAT

""Prosecutors said the secret sect’s purpose within Nxivm was to groom sexual partners for Mr. Raniere, who is 58. It was called D.O.S., an acronym for a Latin phrase that roughly translates to “Lord/Master of the Obedient Female Companions,” court papers said"" 

""Prosecutors have said that the women were warned that the damaging or embarrassing information would be made public if they revealed the existence of the group.""

Wtf?!??
I don't see her on the campus directory?
Wowsers. She is a major part of “The Vow” docuseries on HBO right now.


https://www.hbo.com/the-vow
good god. this story deserves way more traction.
Maybe she misunderstood the abstract of the class and thought it was a training course for sex-traffickers. I mean, if your moral compass is that fucked up, ""Gender, Sex and Power"" could sound like the abuser's equivalent of a food handler's certification.
She hasn't been sentenced yet; that's been delayed due to COVID 19. That's why she's could still be around campus (virtually, of course.)
She’s in my English 45B class this semester 😳
Is this the bitch that had women get KR branded on their genitals?!!!
Wow I want to know what's going on at Admissions LMAO.
I think everyone here should send an email to the Berkeley head of admissions. I am going to do so as well. I am going to let them know that I am very dissapointed in thier oversight in allowing this person admission and that they have put the entire student body in risk of danger. And that they hold ***legal liability*** for not doing a background check as they are supposed to because they are putting the rest of the student body at risk. They should not only lose their job but also be wary of legal repercussions for such a dangerous oversight. 

I GUARANTEE you this will shake them up and force them to review their admissions operations.
Can someone post this on Overheard on Facebook?
You can stream the docu-series on HBO. It’s called “The Vow”.
I did not even know people like her even could get into college. Why is this criminal even allowed to attend.

Edit - Better question: Why should this criminal get to attend when there are BETTER people out there who desperately wanted to attend but couldn't get in?
Hi. I'm the mod of r/theNXIVMcase. I thank you for your patience here, because I'd like to make a few points from following the case:

* **Mack's role in NXIVM through 2018 is without dispute. However, her role since her arrest** ***has not*** **been established, and she's likely providing cooperation to the investigation**. She gave a statement denouncing Raniere at her change-of-plea, which went beyond what other members of the cult did. She has also turned on her wife (Nicki Clyne) who remains a member of the cult. She was not called to testify at Raniere's trial, but I believe it very likely that she has been debriefed by prosecutors. 
* In terms of judging her ongoing behavior, folks may be entitled to being wary of her but it's unlikely she is ""recruiting."" Her bail terms have conditions that include no contact with her codefendants. 
* About those bail terms: she is allowed a fair amount of leeway according to modifications of her bail terms. She is allowed exceptions for schooling. Her internet usage is allowed but monitored. She is on a GPS monitor.    
* This said, the appropriate venue to talk to ***if you see a potential violation of probation terms*** is the federal probation office in the [Eastern District of New York](https://www.nyep.uscourts.gov/index.html). This is **not** for  ""zOMG a criminal's auditing my course"" complaints; this is the number if Mack asks you to call Keith Raniere in jail for her.
anybody watch Smallville?
oh my GOD. She was in my section for History of Human Rights until last week. OH MY GODDDDDD what the FUCK.
Crazy how this school rejects some of my smartest most accomplished friends from high school with 4.5s then will accept a literal sex trafficker... this is why the Berkeley reputation is becoming tarnished slightly in the last ten or so years
transferring to ucla is looking better and better each day
I've been watching The Vow, and that is a sick twist to find this out. I really hope that there is some resolution to this. 

Otherwise, perhaps contacting media outlets that have been covering her trial extensively may put pressure on administration to reconsider.
I'd just like to mention to everyone here, that she not only pleaded guilty and denounced raniere (who was the leader of the cult, not her), but she is likely cooperating with the government.  This isn't known for sure, but it would explain why the judge approved her request to go to church and school, and why the prosecution didn't object.  

Also, while the case is very complex and you can watch the documentary that came out or read numerous articles to understand it better, just be aware that many people feel she is to a certain degree a victim as well as a perpetrator.
Another example of  the  incompetency of Berkeley administration.
If someone wants to pursue... conditions of house arrest are that she does not use the internet or a cellphone
Incase you didn't know, Vice made an article based out of this post. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/xg8jv7/nxivm-allison-mack-back-in-college-uc-berkeley
No offense, but this is common in sex trafficking rings. Many of the victims recruit others into it as well, it’s part of it as they usually get some sort of reward, but it also makes them complicit. This makes it so that victims of sex trafficking are unwilling to cooperate with authorities as they’ll be implicated, making it worse. The same thing happened with Jeffrey Epstein and his sex trafficking ring, he preyed on vulnerable girls in nearby poorer areas, if he could have sex with them he would, even if they didn’t he would then pay them if they brought friends. This meant that few of his victims were willing to cooperate, and what made it so difficult to take down.

It sounds like she’s trying to move on, but she should serve jail time for what she did. However I don’t think it’s fair to say she’s still the same kind of person, as she’s probably a victim of the same thing as well.
Summer has open enrollment.
Who the fuck cares
The woman seems mentally ill and like she just escaped from a cult. Definitely never let her access an education, and publicly ostracize her as she attempts to recover!
Her crimes are publicly known. Classes are remote. What's the worst-case scenario here?
Unless she's making direct or overt threats, it's not anyone's business. She's trying to get an education. Stop making it about you.
[deleted]
So what? Ted Kacsinski taught there.
I think she was in my discussion group for that class! How crazy, I saw the name, but I didn't connect it that she was the same person.
i was in this class and remember her saying that she was an english major.
What the fuck??? That's ironic.
She paid $5 million in bail so she could be under house arrest with her parents in California instead.
she is always recruiting
Can I have your HBO max login so I can watch Raised by Wolves? Help a buddy out.
I mean, it's Berkeley.
Useful context about her current situation here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/isw5fd/theres_a_famous_sextrafficking_cult_leader_at/g5ksfkh/
> she began recruiting other women into a secret sect within Nxivm in which women were branded with Mr. Raniere’s initials and were forced to have sex with him

Interesting that this is how it's described. The women were branded with both Mr. Raniere's initials and Ms. Mack's initials which is part of the whole culpability on her behalf.  

Edit: I looked it up and [she admits to coming up with the whole branding thing in an NY Times interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/magazine/sex-cult-empowerment-nxivm-keith-raniere.html).
Another anonymous student from one of her other classes shared [screenshots.](https://twitter.com/julianfeeld/status/1306001054153076737) I think I can say pretty confidently that the story has not been reported on by any ""reliable"" sources because there are no NYT reporters sitting in our classes waiting for a story to break. In 2018 [Buzzfeed News reported that she was seeking exceptions to her house arrest to work, go to school, and attend church services.](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/krystieyandoli/smallville-allison-mack-sex-cult-house-arrest) While you may not consider Radar Online a reliable source, [they reported several days later that the permission was granted](https://radaronline.com/videos/allison-mack-nxivm-sex-cult-headed-to-college/), and that she would be attending a local junior college in Orange County. This backs up my assertion that she is a new transfer student, and that the UC admitted her after the charges against her were publicly known. Regardless of the timing decisions of the admissions department or the potential that she could just be auditing a class, the school administration is now choosing to defend her privacy over student health and safety, which is the other reason this reddit thread is the first time you're hearing about her presence. When students from my class brought the matter to our professor, she sent out a vague announcement that only acknowledged that several students didn't feel that the class was a safe learning environment and told us to refer back to the agreed upon class discussion policies. Later one of the GSIs announced that they were removing Mack from their discussion section, which was the limit of their power as a GSI. For legal reasons, they could not name Mack in this announcement. They also said that they could not remove her from the course as a whole, also for legal reasons. At the beginning of the next lecture, the professor announced that Mack had left the class voluntarily, but also claimed that she could not name Mack or talk about the charges against her for legal reasons. Many students in the class were confused and had no idea what was going on. I made this post because I couldn't just sit back and let the administration use the law as a way to protect a wealthy sexual predator at the expense of survivors of and people vulnerable to sexual violence. As far as I am aware, because I am a student and not an employee I am not bound to the same privacy laws my professor and GSIs are, but I made the post anonymously because I still fear retribution from my professor and the UC administration. I hope this clears some things up.
Fucking what.
Shouldn’t you kids be concerned with your own lives and studies? Are you bored at Berkeley? If that’s the case they need to revise their curriculum
I won't rule out the possibility that she's no longer a student here. I know the complaint went to Carol Christ's desk, but my classmates and I are being kept in the dark as far as the administrative response goes. Even if they did very quietly expel her to avoid bad press and further controversy, it's disturbing that she was admitted in the first place.
I know at other schools there are circumstances under which a student can request that their name not be listed in the campus directory, and I imagine the same is true at Berkeley.
The brand turned 180 degrees clearly also says AM
Incompetent like always. Means they don't actually check anyones criminal history.
They obviously didn't check her criminal history. Probably don't check anyone's.
I don't think anyone is going to read my response because it's so late, but I've been thinking about Mack's acceptance into UCB and I think too much of the ""news"" relys on internet rumors. Mack plead guilty in July 2019-it's entirely possible that she was accepted to Berkeley and delayed enrollment, aka it is possible that Berkeley admissions didn't know the full scope of her crime until after she was admitted? Also I can't find a single news article definitively saying that she is a Berkeley student-maybe she was simply auditing a class? Took only summer sessions (and is not an official student)?? I know it's possible to take classes through UC Berkeley Extension without being a full-time student (don't quote me, I have homework and can't do extensive research). All in all, there's not enough information here to crucify Berkeley Admissions or any part of Berkeley administration because we simply don't have the full story. Until more information comes out we simply don't know how/why Allison Mack ended up at Berkeley and if Berkeley has a hand in it.
It's been a month since you shared this... did Admissions get back to you?
Somebody saaaaaaaave me!
Yeah she sounds remorseful, but truly how the fuck could Berkeley admit a conspiracy-level criminal when she has an almost certain jail sentence hanging over her head?? Her victims will never get closure if she gets to go to mf Berkeley and not jail. Maybe in a decade or two, after she serves her sentence and has some uplifting story about how she went from sex trafficker to empowering women, but fucking now?!?? 

I'm glad she figured out that what she was doing was wrong, but it has to be said: Ms. Mack went in deep. She had so many moments to stop her crimes and back out. She didn't stop when she was lying to rope in innocent women into this cult. She didn't stop when she pushed out those women's deepest, darkest secrets to blackmail them. She didn't stop when those women were raped. She didn't stop when those women wanted to leave or expose the cult (and instead blackmailed them to stay silent). Allison Mack had many chances to turn back, but she never did until now. She has hurt countless women in the process, some of whom may never recover. She is 100% a criminal deserving of punishment. AND SHE GOT INTO BERKELEY. WHAT THE FUCK DID SHE WRITE IN HER ESSAY: ""after irreversibly harming the lives of countless innocents, I grew as a person and want to continue growing with the unique, world-class experience that Berkeley has to offer"". WHAT THE FUCK BERKELEY, ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND.
Would you be so generous with Ghislaine Maxwell?
Fuuuuuck oooooooffff
[deleted]
Can someone translate this?
Uh. Yeah. BEFORE he was caught...
She was using a nickname form of her first name, probably for this exact reason.
Yeah, she’s in English 45B this semester
When you're an English major and a former transfer student 👁👄👁
Well, I’m glad to be wrong then if that’s the case.
We really do have the best legal system in America...
Ah, yes. Money.
Now the question is, why is she here??
The bail was $5MM. But bail bonds cost 10% of the bail (usually). You can find some that are cheaper (around 7%). So they likely paid $350 - $500k.
???
holy fuck I could not finish reading that article, this is beyond horrific
Damn, thanks for the screenshots and research. I'm now at convinced that she at least attended a class at UCB and somehow UC Berkeley administration had a hand in it. I agree that radaronline might not be reliable, so I'm not *fully* convinced that she's a student, but I'm genuinely surprised that staff has to stay quiet about her existence because of privacy laws (you would think that they would raise more noise if a conspiracy-level criminal attended class). When I was looking for more info about Mack at Berkeley I was expecting at least the Daily Cal or SF Chronicle, or even some fringe student newspaper/magazine at UCB to run an article on something as momentous as this. When I didn't find any I was very very surprised and it set off my bs alarm. But if privacy laws are preventing reporting then it'll make sense that there is basically no information. This entire thing reeks and we students deserve more information, because Mack isn't an ordinary criminal and this is no ordinary school.
I'm sorry but what part of ""a person WHO HAS ADMITTED sexually abusing and branding young women is sitting in classes and roaming a campus with HER EXACT TYPE OF VICTIMS AND THEY ARE UNCOMFORTABLE AND FEEL UNSAFE"" do you not get? 

The poster didn't post random gossip but is someone who sees an ADMITTED DANGEROUS PREDATOR and doesn't want that person to be able to rape, abuse, brand or otherwise hurt their classmates. If this was the South Hill or Spiderman or other male multiple torturer and rapist and it were your daughter in the class ... does that change your thinking? If this were dish dish I'd get your point (although in a world full of the Housewives, Big Brother, etc. shows that are nothing BUT gossip clearly it's been made acceptable,) but either way: this ain't that.
that's kind of ridiculous and unacceptable though. They don't do background checks? Felons are welcome? I wonder if that is the case with all universities including places like Harvard.
let your WARM hands BREAK RIGHT THROUGH IT
nice not-loaded response, very rational. Very Berkeley
Exactly. Why should this criminal get to attend when there are BETTER people out there who desperately wanted to attend can't?
You don't think women's studies classes might be a good way to rehabilitate a criminal?
She is obviously free.
Pretty shit but def not the worst.
People complain about shit like this and then complain when our government doesn’t have enough money to do anything
Million million?
Hyper liberal and progressive. Wouldn't put it past them to overlook it and give her a second chance.
Fuck you. I’m a felon and good. Oh yeah lets just take all opportunities in life away from people with a felony. Dipshit.
Nonviolent felons deserve a chance to better themselves, the fact that they get lumped in with people like this is wrong in my opinion.
I mean, it's a bit cheeky, but I think still a valid question. This is honestly the first I'm hearing of this girl, but reading the articles that people have posted here, she certainly seems like she was happy to go along with it. If there is some meaningful difference,  I'd love to hear it, but you can be exploited and abused by someone while also bearing responsibility for your own actions at the same time.
I believe if she wants to learn and grow as a person these kinds of classes are a great option, but it is entirely inappropriate for somebody with her history to be physically present and/or actively participate with others in a course where many of the students are from demographics that are statistically more vulnerable to sexual abuse. That’s not fair to everybody else. She can study independently or listen in on recorded lectures after class hours. She may well have been a victim of grooming/brainwashing herself, but her actions still have consequences and her presence makes a lot of students feel unsafe.
Berkeley shouldn't have admitted her simply because she is a convicted criminal who is likely to serve out an extended (20 years) jail time. It's not UC Berkeley's job to rehabilitate a criminal, and it's definitely not Berkeley's job to admit a criminal before she has been rehabilitated.
Considering she apparently needs to start from fucking body autonomy I think there are places besides Berkeley she could've been taught the basics.
Universities expel for hate speech. I think sex trafficking is much more severe. I'm pro rehabilitation, but people who run a cult that enslaved and raped others don't deserve to take up university resources that could go to people who aren't evil.
She hasn't even served her sentence yet.
She’s under house arrest lmao
You know bail is a bond, right? The government pays it back when you show up for sentencing.
""MM"" is the standard abbreviation for ""million."" It comes from Latin, literally meaning M (1,000 in Roman numerals) multiplied by M.
there's a difference between a felon who stole food to feed their family and a literal sex trafficker.
well then, at the very least, there should be a way to differentiate the felons who have made a change in their life to go in the right direction vs. those who have not
To be fair we don’t know the full story and even though she did do these terrible things (that she should be in jail for imo) I don’t think you’re in a position to claim that she should’ve held her moral obligations and dignity. “You can be exploited and abused by someone while also bearing responsibility for your own actions at a the same time” is what I’m referring to.
To nitpick, she's not ""physically present"". But perhaps she's better off staying away from the live-discussions, if it's negatively impacting the learning environment for vulnerable people.
The Tri Delts house?
MM... Kay.
This is why I said and/or: she’s still present via a live webcam, but had in person classes been allowed, I was trying to say I thought it would also be wrong if she was actually sitting in a classroom. Sounds like she’s under house arrest for now, though.
Prior to the pandemic she was allowed to attend classes and go to church physically as an exception to her house arrest. I don't think it's a stretch to say that if our semester was in person she would have been physically present. She's quite wealthy and can clearly afford very good lawyers.
I did not know she could attend classes in person prior! Wow... That’s absurd."
Actor [and current Cal student] Allison Mack faces sentencing in NXIVM sex-slave case,https://apnews.com/article/allison-mack-religion-sentencing-entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-8788f420e18b6d48cf255aa8c3b5fe13,2021-06-30 15:08:38,,"To pre-empt any doxxing reports, she's a public figure and:
 
> According to her mother’s letter [submitted in the court case], Mack earned an associate’s degree in spring 2020 with a 4.0 grade point average. She’s since attended classes at UC Berkeley and is scheduled to graduate in Spring 2022 with a double major in Rhetoric and Psychology.

https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/allison-mack-nxivm-sentencing-jail-time-1235005925/
If she actually gets her degree from Berkeley I’m throwing mine away. How did a school that promotes things like women’s rights and consent enroll someone who was directly responsible for systematic (cult) rapes, ESPECIALLY while she was being actively investigated?!?!

I’ve been following the news surrounding Mack for a while, giving her and UCB the benefit of the doubt, because internet rumors can’t automatically be trusted. But now that she has been properly found guilty and convicted UCB has some real explaining to do. (Worst of all, it looks like she has only been sentenced to 3 YEARS, and there is a chance that those years might be served through house arrest. In other words, for her heinous crimes against innocent women instead of receiving prison time she might actually just lockdown and quarantine for 3 more years in sunny california while taking zoom classes like any other non-criminal student. WTF)

If she actually graduates from Berkeley I’m throwing away my degree, because fuck that shit. Berkeley was a hard and stressful school, and while I graduate hating academics I still have (had?) complete trust in UCB graduates and staff for being upstanding people. If someone like Mack somehow obtains her degree then that trust is completely invalidated. 

How did Mack even get admitted in the first place? What a shitshow.
Our classmate, everyone!!!
Her [ statement](https://legacy.npr.org/assets/artslife/arts/2021/allisonmack2.pdf):

To those who have been harmed by my actions,  
To this date, it has been over three years since I last communicated with most of you.  
This period of isolation has been the most devastating, but transformative time of my life.  
Because of the court's decision to allow me to remain on home-confinement, I have had the  
opportunity to be alone with my thoughts in the most supportive and loving environment. Such  
an opportunity has offered me the time and strength I needed to confront the darkest parts of  
myself and come to terms with the pain my actions have inflicted on so many people I love,  
which is the reason for this letter. It is now of paramount importance to me to say, from the  
bottom of my heart, I am so sorry. I threw myself into the teachings of Keith Rainire with  
everything I had. I believed, whole-heartedly, that his mentorship was leading me to a better,  
more enlightened version of myself. I devoted my loyalty, my resources, and, ultimately, my life  
to him. This was the biggest mistake and greatest regret of my life.  
I am sorry to those of you that I brought into Nxivm. I am sorry I ever exposed you to the  
nefarious and emotionally abusive schemes of a twisted man. I am sorry that I encouraged you  
to use your resources to participate in something that was ultimately so ugly. I do not take lightly  
the responsibility I have in the lives of those I love and I feel a heavy weight of guilt for having  
misused your trust, leading you down a negative path. I am sorry to those of you whom I spoke  
to in a harsh or hurtful way. At the time, I believed I was helping. I believed in tough love and  
thought it was the path to personal empowerment. I was so confused. I never want to be  
someone who is considered mean, but those aspects of my humanity have been revealed in all  
of this; it has been devastating to reconcile.  
I have experienced overwhelming shame as I have worked to accept and understand all  
that went on and all that I chose. There were times I was not sure I would make it through this  
alive, the pain was so crippling. That said, I know that coming out the other side, I am a better,  
kinder woman because of this. I know I cannot heal the pain my betrayal has caused to you and

your loved ones, but I can promise you that your hurt has not gone unseen and acknowledging  
this has changed me to my core.  
I also want to apologize to all the friends and loved ones I have hurt throughout this  
process who were not involved in Nxivm. I know many of you fought hard to show me the truth  
about Nxivm and Keith, but I didn't listen. I pushed you away and silenced myself toward you  
when you were trying to save my life. I am sorry I was so stubborn. I am sorry I was blind to  
your care and deaf to your pleas. I wish with everything in me that I had chosen differently, but I  
cannot change the past. I lied to you, again and again, in order to protect the delusion I was so  
deeply committed to believing. I know that the sacred trust I broke cannot be reinstated without  
forgiveness and a significant passage of time. While I desperately miss my friends, I understand  
if you choose not to invest in a future that includes me. However, I hope you will accept this  
sincere apology and know that I will hold all of you close to my heart for the rest of my life, even  
if we never speak again.  
The list of those harmed by the collateral damage of my destructive choices continues to  
grow as I become more and more aware of how my choices have affected those around me. I  
am grateful that I have made it through this process alive and that I was stopped when I was. I

Disgusting that she is still a Berkeley student
>How did Mack even get admitted in the first place?

She probably applied, and included in her application compelling details that you and I are not privy to. 

> (Worst of all, it looks like she has only been sentenced to 3 YEARS, and there is a chance that those years might be served through house arrest. In other words, for her heinous crimes against innocent women instead of receiving prison time she might actually just lockdown and quarantine for 3 more years in sunny california while taking zoom classes like any other non-criminal student. WTF)

Based on the article, Mack has agreed to cooperate and testify against others in the cult, which allows them to charge other members that they otherwise couldn't or would have difficulty convicting. 

I knew a girl in high school was convicted of a shooting along with her boyfriend. She got life in prison because the guy (a repeat offender) made a deal to say she pulled the trigger. The guy got a lesser sentence, even though he was probably the actual trigger-puller, because otherwise the girl (who was still not innocent even if she didn't pull the trigger) would have walked. So if Mack could help get the ring leader, it's incredibly logical that she would get a reduced sentence. 

>If she actually graduates from Berkeley I’m throwing away my degree, because fuck that shit. Berkeley was a hard and stressful school, and while I graduate hating academics I still have (had?) complete trust in UCB graduates and staff for being upstanding people. If someone like Mack somehow obtains her degree then that trust is completely invalidated.

First of all, it is strangely refreshing to me that you would have such faith in UCB in the first place. 

Second, I would hope that the decision of A) the NY Justice Dept and B) the UCB Admissions Dept would not completely disrupt that trust. There are a lot of good people here. I know so many staff members who work countless extra hours to support students and fight for them. You should neither blindly trust in them because of an institution name, nor blindly throw away any sense of trust because of a perceived tarnishment. 

Third, it sounds like you had a really rough time during your time at UCB. The thing about college, and indeed about life in general, is that no experience is blanket good or bad. Even though it sounds like you endured hardship here, probably with a really tough major and potentially some unforgiving teachers or peers, you learned some valuable lessons that you can carry on with you. I wish you healing and success as you continue to move forth in the world.
Seriously? Are you actually against the idea of convicts earning college degrees? People in prison earn college degrees all the time. You think they don't deserve to attend a good school? You think your education is invalidated by the fact that someone you think you're better than is also getting educated? Grow up

Okay. No one asked you.
Keeping in mind she is actively pursuing a degree in what was it? Psychology and rhetoric?
Yes, I wonder how many of us average normies would have been admitted initially, or kicked out if we had this on our recent track records. My guess is most of us would not have been given this kind of privilege.
I remember last summer when she was taking a GWS class, she was apparently trying to make connections with female students and all that. Of course, this is just a rumor and she might as well have been simply trying to make friends, but I still find it eerie.
Academically I struggled at Berkeley, but the students and staff members have been nothing short of wonderful. It’s worth pointing out that I have had close experience with reporting a sexual assault and watched how the student in question got support. As far as I could tell UCPD, staff, etc were incredibly supportive throughout the process. Which is why Mack’s admission is truly surprising to me. I was willing to give UCB the benefit of the doubt before, but now that Mack’s been properly convicted are they really going to let her continue??

I also knew about her compliance reducing her sentence, but I still find that infuriating.
If you’re not upset about Mack’s enrollment and instead want to focus on the impossible task of deleting 4 years of my life be my guest. OBVIOUSLY I can’t go back in time and not attend Berkeley, but I can stop donating and supporting UCB in every other way. There is no point giving money to an institution willing to condone rapists. Also, I’m at that point in my career where my connections matter more than my degree. Not leveraging my Berkeley degree for the future would be sad because I still have lots of faith in this school but not impossible.
That’s correct I think.
You might want to read her mother's statement. It is enlightening, *especially* on the academic side. I hadn't read this before my initial comment, but I was randomly browsing NPR and found it. I don't know her or much about her, and never watched or listened to whatever made her famous, nor do I have much info about what crimes she committed, but it sounds like she might be a person under there.

Sounds like maybe she went to somewhere else first and then transferred here? In which case, perhaps her student statement was about redemption. I can imagine being moved by that, and deciding to admit her even if it was an unpopular move to those who hadn't read it. 

I was sexually assaulted (not here, but at another UC) and watched as the system failed. But I survived and, in a time, thrived. As an advocate for students I am doing better for those I can aid. And I also believe in reform, including for people like Mack and like my own assaulter, whose name I don't even remember.

Thanks for the link! It’s a long pdf and don’t have time to read it now but I’ll definitely skim it later. I’m also really sorry to hear about your assault and I’m glad you’re doing better.

While no one knows what happened during the application process, I too also suspected that she was admitted because of redemption. I know she is remorseful and I also absolutely believe people can learn from their past, but I still think her admission was wrong because wounds are still too fresh: while Mack was admitted to UCB the victims of NXIVM still had to relive their traumas for the sake of the trial. Mack was taking zoom classes, like a normal UCB student while the victims had to wait in limbo for a sentencing. Obviously I’m not a victim nor am I involved with them, so I do not know how they are truly feeling and thus might be wrong. However, from my experience healing from sexual assault doesn’t happen overnight. I’ve seen the impact assault has on people and it truly disturbs me. If Mack had been admitted to Berkeley after serving out her 3 year sentence I wouldn’t be so angry because not only has Mack been given the chance to think about her actions, the women wronged by Mack would also have been given a chance to move on. Admitting Mack to UCB before her 3 years is like discounting the crimes Mack committed and telling the victims that everything they suffered through doesn’t matter, because while they are still suffering and healing Mack is allowed to attend one of the best universities in the world.

(In case it needs mentioning, I’m really happy that the other cult members have been sentenced, they absolutely deserved it). 

I’m not too sure how to link my own comment, but if you check my post history you can see the original post by a student saying that Mack was in his/her summer class. At that time I defended UCB, but now that Mack has been sentenced I can’t defend UCB’s decision any longer. It’s not clear if Mack will graduate from Berkeley but I’m already disgusted enough and will probably distance myself from the college I graduated from.
I read a couple of these character references, and one thing specifically strikes me as distasteful. There's a common theme of her being under Keith Raniere's control, being controlled, dominated, and brainwashed by him. However, the victims claimed that they were similarly victimized by Allison Mack and worse. Obviously, both of these statements can be true, and one contributed to the other. It just feels disingenuous to avoid any mention of what she actually did like raping and branding the victims. I do believe in the ability to change, but her letter seemed a bit too tailored towards obtaining a shorter sentence than genuine remorse.
Kaczynski was an assistant professor at Berkeley from 1967-1969. He didn’t commit acts of terrorism until 1978.

Associating the unabomber with Berkeley, or more specifically blaming UCB for hiring Kaczynski, about a decade before Kaczynski’s bombing spree doesn’t make sense. In contrast, Mack was admitted to Berkeley while under active investigation for her rather clear involvement in NXIVM. If you search this subreddit you’ll find the post where a students in Mack’s summer classes exposed Mack’s attendance, because back then even students knew she was likely guilty.

Also ngl your post history is a bit much to take in.
Considering that she seems to be bound for Federal Prison, combined with most classes resuming being in person, I will be surprised if she can finish her degree in AY 21-22. Especially given her double major. Then again my husband and cousin were both transfers who finished in less than two years.

I am not sure what mechanism would get an enrolled student removed for a conviction from a  pending trial. If her conduct as a student has been unseemly she should be reported for breaking the code of conduct. I’ve seen such cases before.
Also, thank you for a thoughtful discussion. Given your POV I might very well come to the same conclusions.
You are not wrong. There is no easy way to discern between true repentance and simply trying to get out of trouble. 

As for what she’s done that was wrong, the prosecution no doubt went into ample detail. It is not the job of the criminal to go into lengthy details about their misdeeds when asking for clemency. Furthermore, had she done so it would have certainly been redacted, a fact of which she is obviously aware."
