Fall 2020 Update - Remote instruction will be an option; no tuition / campus fee refunds (lol),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/g6rwvu/fall_2020_update_remote_instruction_will_be_an/,2020-04-23 11:24:14,"Dear undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students,

We understand that many students have questions about campus plans for the fall 2020 semester. We wish to share information with you as proactively as possible while we carefully observe the progress of the current pandemic. 

Like universities around the world, we are working towards making critical decisions for the coming academic year in this evolving situation. We have an FAQ website that we will update as more details are announced. 

In-person vs. remote instruction decisions
We will not cancel the fall semester. We are working closely with our local public health officials to determine when we will resume in-person instruction. At this time we don’t have an estimated date. Some or all instruction for all or part of Academic Year 2020-2021 may be delivered via remote instructio n. We do not know exactly when these decisions will be made because the public health picture remains uncertain. We are monitoring the situation closely and will make a decision about the fall semester as soon as there is enough information to do so. The health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff will always be our top priority.

Given the uncertainty the world faces, some students may not be able to safely travel to campus. **We plan to continue to offer remote instruction as an option for Fall 2020, even if classes are held in-person.**

We’re making every effort to minimize disruptions to our educational mission and recognize that many students are eager to return to campus as soon as possible. When we do resume in-person instruction, it will likely be a phased approach with certain types of classes considered more appropriate to resume in-person than others. We will also likely make changes within classrooms and laboratories to observe publ ic health directives and guidance such as increased hand washing, avoiding sharing equipment when possible, and recommendations on facial coverings and/or physical distancing. Decisions about broadly offering Passed/Not Passed (P/NP) or Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grading for fall semester will be made by the Academic Senate and will take into account the situation at the time. We appreciate your patience as we weigh these factors and gather more information about what the situation may be like in the fall. 

Tuition and student fees for fall 2020
**Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the Academic Year. Mandatory university charges for tuition and student services continue to help cover ongoing operations such as the delivery of instruction and the cost of student services such as registration, financial aid, and remote academic advising.**

Some campus-based fees were established to support certain efforts like the Wellness Fee which is paying for many essential health services. Others were established to maintain the safety of buildings or other facilities when necessary for the health and safety of students—e.g., to address seismic deficiencies. Even as UC campuses such as ours have curtailed limited aspects of their operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the costs that campus-based fees are intended to cover will continue.

Student housing for fall 2020 
Under normal operations, all new students receive priority for housing. It is not possible to know at this time whether the COVID-19 pandemic will allow for normal operations in student housing and residential life in Academic Year 2020-2021. Consequently, we cannot guarantee housing priority at this time but we are committed to supporting students if they want to liv e on or near campus.   

For returning students, if fall classes are offered via remote instruction, we want to empower you to make the best decision for you and your family. We will keep the residential halls and apartments open as they are the primary residence for many students, unless we are required by public health authorities to close them. To date, we have not received any such closure order. If you do choose to live in University owned or affiliated housing, we will allow students the opportunity to be relieved of the financial obligations of their housing and applicable dining contracts and receive a prorated refund if the campus doesn’t resume in-person instruction during the 2020-2021 academic year or ends in-person instruction for an extended period of time (for example, in-person instruction is cancelled for more than 30 consecutive instructional days). 

For off-campus housing, students should pay close attention to the terms o f their lease. Most off-campus leases will not provide prorated refunds if students leave mid-lease. Consider trying to negotiate with the landlord for a month-to-month lease. This will give you more flexibility. Given the circumstances, some landlords may be more willing to negotiate. Learn more about leases at sa.berkeley.edu/legal/tipsheet/leases.


We thank you for your understanding and resilience during these challenging and uncertain times. We are committed to providing students with the best educational experience possible and we will continue to inform you of the latest developments for the coming fall. 

Sincerely,

Lisa García Bedolla, Vice Provost for Graduate Studies and Dean of the Graduate Division

This message was sent to all undergraduate and graduate students.","Since they guaranteed remote instruction, how would exams possibly work if in-person instruction continues? 

I think this GUARANTEES that take-home/jank online gradescope exams will continue fall semester. Not only can you not social distance with 700 people taking an exam in Wheeler, but logistically it's a huge hassle if half of the course is taking an online exam with completely different format.

How the hell you curve that?
As a senior graduating in a couple weeks, although I was initially really sad about not getting to finish my college career in Berkeley, it’s becoming more and more apparent that graduating now is actually a lot more good than bad... I feel for you guys who are gonna have to put up with multiple semesters of this
[deleted]
I said this in another tread but allow me to repeat myself here: I’m most scared of the situation where we come back to school in person in the fall thinking the virus is all over and then it makes a come back in October mixed in with the regular seasonal flu and we all panic and have to scramble home again like we did this semester.... idk how likely this would be cuz I have no background in public health, but I did read on the news that someone at CDC said a second wave is possible and even likely. Please correct me if I understand the situation wrong, but with that (potentially big) possibility in mind I really don’t know if we should resume in person school at all for the fall:(
I mean someone has to pay for all the infrastructure right? As long as they don't charge for housing, it makes sense to me.
Getting spring admission is looking like more of a blessing every day
[deleted]
Seems like it's probably time to start making plans for deferral. For people planning to do so, what will you try to do for your gap semester? Remote internship?
I'm paying out-of-state tuition while living in-state. What the actual fucking fuckity fuck.
I find it interesting that they seem inflexible with regard to tuition and fees when they have to understand that such inflexibility will inevitably lead to a large proportion of students withdrawing for the semester.  I wonder what measures they will take regarding this.  It's a huge loss either way.
Why can’t they give some campus fee refunds e.g. RSF, AC Transit, and other services that we cannot use? I find it really unreasonable. Yea sure we’ll have access to staff through online classes which is ok to pay for but the issue is that we’re paying for services that we can’t even use!! Tell me where the money for our RSF membership that we’re paying for is going to when the gym is closed?? This is just really unreasonable. Considering the added fact that I already signed a lease for off-campus housing in January and now they can’t even give us a concrete answer so that I know whether I should argue to terminate the lease or not 🤦🏻‍♀️
RIP a digital year abroad isn’t quite the same thing
If fall semester is remote too I’m taking a gap semester
Mannn... I just hope whatever decision they make will be a solid decision. I don’t want to stress over whether I should choose online school for fall or if I should go in person to have that freshman experience. Just pick one!! I’m a horrible decision maker 😖😖
Oh man, I guess I'll miss out on those AC transit bus rides where tens of people get crammed into a bus for a few minutes at a time. Honestly, those should be refunded since people probably won't be willing to get on a bus during fall semester if there are still some social distancing restrictions due to the lack of a vaccine.
I do not understand why people are confused by this concept.  Just because you are not physically on campus does not mean you are not going to be receiving a UC education (exception being to the equipment and archives that are available).

As a graduate students at Davis I still had to pay tuition even though I had a remote program.  I was not confused by this concept when it happened 5 years ago.  Why would it be different now?
RIP to the people living off campus. So essentially, would labs for all classes be cancelled then, since if students are given the option to go remote, I doubt classes like Chemistry, Bio, and Physics can hold their in person labs.
Can we physically still go tho?
Exam format are likely up to instructor but I think everyone will take the same exam and in-person attendees would be treated the same as online attendees, since there's no way to do the reverse.
Maybe, just maybe, and hear me out on this one, _curving isn't a fair or reasonable way of grading a class_, so this is the perfect time to get rid of it.
Same here. I still take walks on campus but it's depressing how few students there are. Can't imagine a whole sem of this :(
I'll be the first student in the history of UCB to attend frow Hawaii.
At least this time they’ll have had some preparation time as opposed to having to scramble to hobble together an online class in the middle of the semester.
Yeah, the possibility of a second wave is very real, especially if we have a ton of students fly in from other cities + increase daily public transport. This is a reason behind their uncertain tone ""we're still waiting for public health etc, but for now we guarantee an online option"".
you are right, and I don't think schools like UC Berkeley would risk this even if majority of schools are. So the chance of canceling in-person classes is much higher than what many people are thinking(I would say 90+%). It's good to be optimistic but you cannot risk even a single student.
Yeah if my daughter was college-aged I’d most likely pull her out for the fall and find something productive for her to do around the house or at least be an unofficial intern for my wife and I. Can’t imagine being a college student through all of this.
I think many people getting angry about those fees aren't thinking about the numerous employees (not faculty) who would have no means of getting paid if not for those fees remaining to fund daily (minimum) operations, maintenance, security, etc. It's easy to assume those fees are just the university taking our money for kicks, but it doesn't feel like that's what they're doing.
God damn, I'm actually jealous.

Just got in after 3 years of community college, and now I'm losing 1/2 of my years at Berkeley for sure ☹️
Fall 2020 will at least have optional online classes. I don't know what the breadth of that will be, at least any course that's a major requirement or degree requirement.

The email leaves the possibility of either partial online (online for a bit, then in-person), or in person with social distancing measures, or completely online.

Though personally, I think it's pretty likely to be online at this point.
IDK it's really hard to plan because of the uncertainty. Personally, I will still enroll if it is hybrid instruction, but if it's fully remote, I'll most likely withdraw. But this really depends on the state of rest of the world. If we're back in ""lockdown mode,"" then I doubt companies will be hiring interns, much less min-wage jobs other than essential workers. In that case, I might just take a couple of classes because I would rather attempt to further my education rather that spend a semester doing a min wage job since my parents will most likely still be employed. 

However, if the rest of the world returns to ""normal"" and the only (main) thing that's online are colleges, then I would likely take the semester off and either find an internship or another job. But idk who will be hiring so it's really hard to decide so early, because if you can't find a job, the semester is completely wasted.
I will likely simply audit the classes I would have been taking (I doubt they will be gating anything).
tbf part of that is ostensibly at least in-state residents have supported the university through state taxes (and yes, some people just moved, there are exceptions)
One large reason that ""the situation remains fluid"" is because, as essentially a running business, they need to balance trade-offs. How much money will they lose by cutting tuition, vs. how much money do they lose by retaining tuition but losing students? (profit margins vs. revenue volume)

One reason I can think of with retaining tuition is that they get to keep the money-making whale in the room - international students. 

Out of state is ~$43,000, and in-state is ~$14,000, effectively making international students **x3 times more financially valuable**. They also have been making up larger and larger portions of campus population over the past few years. Most importantly, international students will likely be much more accepting of remote education because of travel restrictions, family obligations, as well as personal identification of where their home is (for example, the common theme of ""I'm going to America to get a degree, then coming back to my home country to work"")

But your logic still stands. This email, as well as watching the enrollment numbers, is a way for them to begin to test the waters and see how many people get spooked, and if they lose too much money, they will try something else. Because if they close campus or lose too many students, they stand to lose [hundreds](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-16/uc-reeling-under-staggering-coronavirus-costs-the-worst-impacts-all-at-once) of [millions](https://old.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fwrwjo/uc_berkeley_expects_100_million_loss_by_end_of_may/) of dollars.
I find it interesting that you think Cal is able to change tuition and fees as an individual university. Also, that you believe that any outcome is ""inevitable"" because it is one you might choose.
It makes me even more reluctant to attend the in-person or at all. This is comming off as: in-person option = half effort to keep up appearance and retain tuition.
People aren't confused, they take offense at the disconnect of paying money for a Berkeley education (which is normally in person) and instead receiving remote instruction, which is an objectively poorer learning experience. Sure, the piece of paper you will get handed at the end of four years stays the same, but what you gained along the way is measurably less.
Well, yeah, so everyone will take the online exam, which also can't be proctored.

Otherwise it would be incredibly unfair for the online kids to take an unproctored version of the same exam lol.
100% agree.
[deleted]
they will *most certainly* be cobbling together an online class again. it's just that this time they will have hopefully learned a bit.

edit: meaning, nobody is going to use the format *well*, like a class designed from the ground up would, but will instead still deliver the content exactly as they did before, but will have some tweaks because they now know how to use zoom.
and you can't force some students not to come. you either cancel it for everyone or give the option to everybody to attend. second option would need to ensure 40 thousand students from 100+ countries to be not sick. What are the odds....
If your daughter were college-aged, she'd be an adult, perfectly capable of making that decision for herself. But I understand that's what you'd do for _yourself_ in this situation.
Haha I’m 19 and my parents are advising me to withdraw for fall semester as well. My mom almost teared up last night saying she just wants to protect her little girl:( on another note tho, Im afraid that fall enrollment might look pretty ugly.
As a staff person, thank you for thinking of us.

Even with fees staying where they are, we are looking at massive cuts to departmental budgets. This comes as we were just *barely* done with the last round of belt-tightening to balance the campus budget. It's not going to be pretty.
Yea man I feel the pain. I was considering I’m going to UCLA if I got accepted but the spring admission is actually an opportunity I can pass lol
[deleted]
Let me rage.  
Jokes aside, you're right. It just feels bad.
As an international student I actually feel like... most of my friends and I are considering withdrawing if it’s fully online or due to some travel restriction we can’t physically get to america. Hugely due to the fact that it’s so expensive and being in a different time zone makes online school horrible. But that’s a very small sample size of just less than 10 of the people I talked to, might be wrong.
Wait so if I'm OOS, but they decide to do remote instruction for my classes, I still have to pay that huge tuition cost???
In person also requires rent btw:(
 very much agreed. Though maybe a relatively empty campus wouldn't be that bad if all facilities are open. It will be tough to tell how to make the decision.  Weighting the value of potentially lowered services with a much lower population using them.
Yes, and it is an entitled, bratty viewpoint because there are programs that are remote for grad school at Berkeley and other institutions and they need to be paid for.  I did not feel that was the case for my program at Davis (the first component of was in person).  In fact the remote learning was far better because there was a lot of down time that was cut out of things.

One loses the social aspect of college, but that is not what you're paying for when you pay tuition.
Hopefully there are other ways of evaluation that doesn't favor cheaters. For instance more weight on assignments/projects, etc. where we already have ways to detect copying. Some summer classes are also experimenting with this I think. Also, humanities could always give open-ended essays questions and check for plagarism like they alsways do.
well it's basically confirmed that there will be an online option so it means a majority of things will be online
But it might be, so there’s no reassign they shouldn’t be at least a little more prepared than getting blindsided in the middle of a semester.
That is very true... with that 90% chance of inperson instruction being canceled, what do you think fall enrollment would look like? I just don’t think my OOS tuition would be worth it if it’s online:(
Lol. She’s only one so it’s hard for me to think that far ahead. But good point.
There is already a hiring freeze that has extended to lecturers (so not just staff), as far as I know that is unprecedented.
 
It's almost guaranteed furloughs at the very least for staff if not significant layoffs. And we never did get back up fully after the disaster that was Campus Shared Services (shudder).

It's going to be very bad before it gets better.
What will get better, though? That's the thing, no matter what the virus is still here in August. We may have lowered the infection rate, new cases, and deaths with shelter in place orders, but the question becomes, how can we soften those while not just immediately causing another wave?

Treatment wise, COVID cases treated hydroxychloroquine apparently have a *higher* fatality rate than those of similar severity not given it. 

Colleges are prime position for viral spread. It involves mass domestic migration, a bunch of people squeezed into close quarters every day, and people living together in the same rooms with strangers.

How do you social distance in a triple? You can't.
I highly doubt it. Even though are age group is “fine” some of us have health complications or people might be living with elderly people. The whole situation sucks
""Just let me bang bro.""

""I do let you bang. I do.""
I'll agree that remote lecture cuts out a lot of downtime between classes where it's too short to walk home and do something else productive. However, this is but a trifle. 

My main point was sure, you can listen to a lecture online and that doesn't drastically alter the learning format of just being talked at, but for other classes, remote instruction just doesn't do them justice. For myself, this includes physics 7B (missed lab component) and environmental design 1 (where in-person site studies in Oakland are/were crucial to the semester-long project). I don't see how this is bratty - experiential learning is key for some people and in other cases, critical to the study of a subject. 

Furthermore, on the notion that ""there are programs that are remote for grad school at Berkeley and other institutions and they need to be paid for"" - the whole principle in these is that they are *planned* remote programs. When choosing a grad school, this is something that is known upfront and can be weighed among the factors of quality of education vs. price when choosing where to go to grad school. In this case, when choosing Berkeley as a the undergraduate program they would go to, students, and especially OOS students, factored that the quality of education justified the cost of attending here. If they had known in May of their high school senior year that one, and possibly two or three semesters would be taught remotely, some might have decided that this is not worth the cost and would have attended a different university. The cost/benefit equation has changed away from what the student expected. Therefore, it's completely justified for the student to wish for a reduction in tuition, or at they very least, bitch about it on reddit. Likewise, the desire of withdrawing for one semester to avoid this expectation/reality mismatch of services rendered is also justifiable.
I don’t mean to get into this but one thing I wanna point out is that, most of the undergrads here at Berkeley didn’t sign up to go to Berkeley thinking that it would be online. It’s great that for you an online education is just as good and I wish I could say the same. But for my major and classes I rely so much on talking to my professors in office hours and collaborating with classmate on projects in person etc. Speaking for myself the quality of online education is reduced. I think people are mad because of this sudden change to what we had agreed to pay for in the first place. (Like if you paid for a year of Spotify and in the middle they suddenly decide to not stream but send you the records you request. Sure the Music you get at the end is the same and you shouldn’t complaint about that, and some people might actually prefer that service, but if that’s not what you organically agreed to sign up for, it might be a little frustrating) that’s just my 2 cents and have a nice day!
> One loses the social aspect of college, but that is not what you're paying for when you pay tuition.

If you’re satisfied with the idea of online classes, go get your degree from the University of Phoenix and save yourself $100,000. It’s the same thing, right?
I believe a lot of students will defer their enrollment or take a gap semester. I really think that all majors(expect five-year ones) can be completed in 3.5 years and you can also always take a summer class for only 2k.  I really don't think Berkeley's (actually nobody's) online education would be worth 20k . 

There is a reason why Berkeley's masters in data science program is considered shitty by many students. It's the same classes taught by the same skilled profs, but it's fully online so it's certainly much easier to get in(since they can enroll more students) and definitely less reputable than masters in engineering. You shouldn't pay that much money for any online program, even something like a masters in data science at Berkeley.
I'm just wondering what will be different in spring 2021. Seems like without a vaccine, we're basically in the exact same situation :(
There are ways you can control that second wave though. For instance, you can phase out move-in times (have Bay Area people come first, then California residents, and so on) so that you can deal with new infections more spread apart. The issue is, you can't *not* have a second wave, unless you do the ""lockdown until there is a vaccine"" thing (which I haven't seen seriously discussed, and there's no guarantee of a vaccine). But, there are ways you can flatten the curve so it isn't as bad as it could be. 

There are also other treatments being tested for COVID besides hydroxychloroquine, so there's a chance there will be one by the fall.

And about social distancing in a triple: none of the guidelines ever apply to people in your dwelling. The issue would be within the bathrooms, dining halls, etc., not with the number of people in one bedroom.
If I read the text improperly, they are not charging lab fees, which means that you are not being charged for services that you would normally recieve.

It is true that remote learning does impact labs (and library and archive access for those of us in the world of Letters, rather than the Sciences), but you have to agree that it is a huge offer to let students not even attend courses but still get access to the education that they want to have.  The University is doing what it can to allow students to be safe while continuing their studies, and it should be commended for that, rather than be criticized for it.

There are many things that the University deserves criticism for, but this is not one of them.
You are being purposefully obtuse.  You have not given one reason why the University would lower tuition because of the circumstances.
Same. I feel like I can easily graduate in 3.5 years in my major so taking a semester off isn't that bad for me personally. I am also slightly concerned about what to do with myself in that time, idk if companies are going to be offering internships at this point and I am a little afraid that I would waste 6 months of my life doing basically nothing productive.
The problem with ""phasing"" move in times is just logistics, and the fact that almost all students other than Freshman don't live in University housing, so they really don't have a good way to control.

If all the OoS sophomores+ just come back, because well they already have to pay for August rent anyway, there's nothing you can do. And they will, because as we all know online learning is kinda ass.

>But, there are ways you can flatten the curve so it isn't as bad as it could be.

Well, yeah, like having services that can be done remotely, done remotely. Like most office work and... university. It sucks, but it's possible, and it helps the rest of the country get back to work. That's the logic.

>There are also other treatments being tested for COVID besides hydroxychloroquine, so there's a chance there will be one by the fall.

There's a chance of everything, but I wouldn't hold my breath for a useful therapeutic

>  none of the guidelines ever apply to people in your dwelling. 

That's for people in *normal* housing, which involves 1-4 people in a house or apartment. This is 3 people, *strangers*, put in the same room. Not a family unit, strangers. 

They're also use the same bathroom, have the same dining hall, touch the same elevator buttons, etc.
Please quote when I said the very fact of the University holding remote lectures is bad. While it's a ""huge offer"" - I'll agree, if there were no classes at all, that would be ridiculous - the University is refusing to reduce tuition for a comparatively *poorer* offer. At the end of the day I don't understand why complaining about that fact is ""entitled and bratty."" 

Is it realistic for the University to reduce tuition? Of course not, it's snatching for pennies when there's no global pandemic - it's going to be hemorrhaging money now as it had been before Christ's improvements. Is it justified to be pissed, nevertheless? I think so. Is it justified to want to not take remote classes next semester to avoid this convenient, but still inferior offer? Yes, and not bratty.
Because they’re providing an objectively inferior product?

Also, props for calling me “obtuse” when you just called students who don’t want to pay full tuition “bratty and entitled”
there are few online internships but don't be sad if none of them works out. if you really wanna do something important, here are some suggestions:

&#x200B;

contact really small startups(from skydeck or anywhere else) and ask them how you can help them remote. most will not be willing to pay you but that would be a great experience. 

take free courses from websites like udemy, you can even get a certificate for it for something like 100$

&#x200B;

start studying some of your spring classes during fall, you would get higher grades or take more courses since you basically know a lot about one of those courses.
Good point about the logistics. I’d imagine that there would be ways of coordinating between the city and the university, but it would be difficult. But there would be some incentive on the city’s part, given how much of city business depends on the student population. 

I’m just more of an optimist about therapeutics than you I guess. Keep in mind like every virologist in the world is working on this. 

About the dorms, the issue isn’t that there are strangers in your room (And they’re not strangers for very long). The issue is the other things you listed (bathrooms, dining halls,etc. ) It’s just not ever possible to social distance from the people you live with, and it’s irrelevant how many people are in the dorm, and whether you know them.
Explain how the education you would receive would be lessened.
>I’d imagine that there would be ways of coordinating between the city and the university, but it would be difficult.

To do what? Bar people from entering the city of berkeley unless they're california residents? I don't even know if the city has legal authority to do that. It probably doesn't lol. 

You can't reasonably stop people in the US from moving domestically, even the federal government can't, it doesn't have the constitutional power to. 

>I’m just more of an optimist about therapeutics than you I guess. Keep in mind like every virologist in the world is working on this.

Yeah, but just having more people work on it doesn't necessarily make anything possible. We never found a therapeutic for SARS or MERS. Hell, we never even made a vaccine for it. They tried, but it took too long (>5 years). 

>It’s just not ever possible to social distance from the people you live with

Yeah exactly, so its optimal to minimize the amount of people you live with. Effectively now, most students will lived with both their families and their roommates, doubling the ""can't possibly social distance"" number.
Some people have different learning styles and some majors benefit more from an in person approach.
I guess you can’t bar non-residents from entering the city, but you can do other things (testing, self quarantine, etc., stuff countries like Taiwan are doing). You can also make compliance voluntary, and I’d guess most people would listen. 

I’m under the impression that research on SARS and MERS slowed down after they went away, but you are right that having lots of people work on it doesn’t make anything impossible possible, only more likely that we find something. 

I still don’t understand your point about social distancing. If you move from a family house of four to a triple room, you are actually decreasing the number of people you’re living with. It’s not like you are now living with both your roommates and your family. I agree with the fact that the conditions in dorms are conducive to the spread of disease, but that would be the situation regardless of the number of the people in the room.
You might be surprised, but as someone with a Masters in Education, I am aware of learning styles, the research around them, and the public discourse that typically mangles what the research actually says.

The major benefit from in person education in an educational context is primarily felt in primary and secondary education where a teacher chooses to read the room and change the way they manage and deliver their content.  This is not something that is done in higher education in general because the expectation is that the student regulates and controls their own focus and effort in the class.  The sole exception to this tends to be in educational classes, and the effect on students who are used to the more mature and independent style of higher education tends to make them feel as if they are being treated in an infantile manner.

If you are entering Berkeley and have not learned to self motivate yourself in your education, then you are in trouble, because you are developmentally behind where you should be.
Personally, I struggle with maintaining focus and an in person class setting really helps me to focus on the physical presence of the speaker and helps my concentration. I also value the interaction I have with peers and going to office hours and clubs and stuff. I would, however, be interested in reading more about the subject and research that you mention so if you could direct me to some primary/secondary texts I’ll be sure to check them out!
For context, when I finished my masters degree, we were the one remote seminar in our program.  In our Zoom sessions we not only had regular chances to interact with our professor but each other, and spent time checking in and talking about our experiences.  We also had regular opportunities to have one on one conversations and office hours with our professor.  There was nothing lost in our experience except not having to spend hours to drive between where we currently resided and going back to campus.

As for the research, I will go digging in my files.  Sadly the days of having access to Google Scholar through UC just disappeared last spring, so I do not have everything I would like to show you.  In short, most education research is very locally specific.  Local conditions, supports, and culture have far more impact on academic outcomes than delivery techniques.  In addition, the most efficient means of transferring information is still proven to be direct instruction (lecture).  Still, we are told not to do it because general educational pedagogy is focused not on being efficient in transferring information but in improving educational outcomes for students with the least academic skills rather than trying to improve the academic outcomes for the majority of students.  Almost all discussions and research about learning styles is about increasing the outcomes of those limited few students who are otherwise not on level for reading, writing, critical thinking, or calculating.  Once again, if you are one of these people, that is support the tutoring center (and consequently the ASUC and student fees) covers, not University tuition."
