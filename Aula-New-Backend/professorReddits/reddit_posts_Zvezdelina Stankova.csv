Stankova or Serganova for Math 54?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16r54yw/stankova_or_serganova_for_math_54/,2023-09-24 11:38:11,"Hi, so next semester I have to take Math 54, and the two professors teaching it are Zvezdelina Stankova and Vera Serganova. I'm trying to decide which one I should take. If anyone had these professors, I'd love to hear your thoughts on their classes. Thanks!","Serganova is alright. Accent aside, lectures aren’t the best but I liked the structure of her class (no hw grades, grade is based on exams/easy weekly quizzes) and I thought her quizzes and exams were extremely fair. She’s no Paulin, but I think her class is a step up from most of the recent 54 instructors (Talaska, Sheu, Wehrheim).

If that class structure sounds good to you I’d go for it!
Personally I like tons of homework and quizzes so that midterm is a walk in the park, no, not that Park.
I had Stankova for 110! She’s really thorough and is an excellent lecturer. Really felt that her teaching helped me build good conceptual understanding. Thorough means homework is long though, fwiw. Would rec.
Always Stankova she’s 🐐
I had Stankova for math 1b and she’s a good lecturer and her notes are the best I’ve seen here, but she gives a lot of hw too. It really prepares you for the exams though.
Thank you very much!
Thanks for your comment!
Thanks for your insight!
Okay, thanks!
I guess if it prepares you for exams then it’s worth it. Thanks for your input!"
mandatory attendances,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/za18kn/mandatory_attendances/,2022-12-01 13:57:33,"Is **NUSCTX 11 attendance mandatory**? ( taught by Sona Kang, Dan Nomura, Jen Chywan Wang)

Do you have any GSI recs?","Attendance is mandatory with Stankova. As for the quizzes, probably Thursday but don't hold me to it.
bruh why was I unaware there were quizzes??? math 1a doesn't have quizzes"
Cs 70 + Math 53 + Physics 7A doable?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kllr8y/cs_70_math_53_physics_7a_doable/,2020-12-27 23:22:03,"Hi fellow bears!

I was wondering if you thought this combo  (Cs 70 + Math 53 + Physics 7A) is reasonable/doable. (I also don't need to declare)

* Cs 70 with prof Rao and Shyam Parekh
* Math 53 with prof Zvezdelina Stankova
* Physics 7A with prof Alex Zettl","yes. math 53 can be a bitch though. and I heard horror stories of 7A pandemic edition. so who knows
sounds very do able. 53 and 7a are relatively light conceptually compared to 70. the struggle will be if midterms are all around the same time otherwise 7a and 53 problem sets aren't bad at all
yup
Stankova did a great job on 110
7A is relatively light, but the midterms are super tough. A 29% was a C on the second MT, so curves help a ton.
hi 26unitsguy! How's it going? Are ya keeping it together with _this_ workload?

Edit: But are you serious?
yeah it was honestly just midterm season that drove me crazy, rest is manageable. Even finals/RRR week was okayish tbh

And yeah I'm serious, maybe add a good breadth like phil 12A to the mix too"
Which math professor would you recommmend?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/g6cbeq/which_math_professor_would_you_recommmend/,2020-04-22 16:53:00,"I haven't taken any uppers for math yet but I'm hearing so many bad things about a lot of profs :k. The classes I'm thinking of are 104(taught by Ian L Charlesworth,Sebastian Eterovic,Koji Shimizu), 110(taught by Zvezdelina Stankova), 113(taught by Semen Artamonov), and 128A(Olga Holtz) Thanks in advance :)","Art for 113 is really good imo, sometimes his lectures and instruction are unclear, but he is a massive chiller and cares that you do well. Fair and all that, I have no exp with the other sorry
I took math 113 with Koji Shimizu and it went pretty well. He is very happy to interact with students and answer questions. I will warn though he does have an accent (I did not find it hard to understand but hey you do you).

I took math 110 with Zvezda and I have been traumatized. I would say the class content is fair but she tends to be rather intimidating. Some people really like her, some people still have nightmares about saying ""dobro utro."" She also has an accent but it is pretty mild (again, you do you). Learning about Bulgaria was cool I guess.

As for the difficulty of classes (from easiest to hardest based on my sad grades): Math 128A, Math 110, Math 104, Math 113.
Holtz I’ve heard is very good for 128A.
Aight, thanks a lot!
Wow is 128A easier than 110? I had not expected that since I always thought 128 is terrible
Got it thanks :)
oof sorry for slow reply. I don't think 128A is easier than 110. However, I did get a higher grade in 128A than math 110. I don't know how that happened but such is life. I took 128A later so perhaps my more developed skills helped.
I see, thanks a lot :))))"
Advice on Spring 2021 Course Schedule + Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jg65ml/advice_on_spring_2021_course_schedule_professors/,2020-10-22 12:05:17,"I’m a freshman and am trying to transfer to COE for either MechE or CivE. I looked on rate my prof and there were some professors that had ratings and some that didn’t show up. Some of the ratings were for other classes the professor taught so I’m not sure if it all applies. If you have any advice on this schedule or the professors teaching these courses or the courses in general please let me know.

Spring 2021

-Chem 1A (Alexis Shusterman)

-Chem 1AL (Michelle Douskey)

-Math 53 (Zvezdelina Stankova)

-Engin 26 (Kourosh Youssefi)

-some r#b course
  
  - French R1B (Trevor Sanders)
 
  - Italian R5B (Mia Fuller) 
 
  - Asian American Studies R2B (David Pham)
 
  - Environmental Design R3B 

TLDR: pls give experience with any of these profs/classes","I'm taking math 53 and chem 1a/1al right now. As far as I can say, chem 1a/1al is a bunch of busy work, that might not all be fun or engaging or interesting or even intellectually stimulating at times, but it really requires you to be on your feet at all times. To be successful in that class, you gotta just either know the material beforehand or just watch a bunch of youtube videos on the topics, either from khan and organic chem tutor. Nothing from lectures has helped me anyway. As for math, it's been ok. As long as you read the book and do the hw, you should be ok.
I took E26 with Youseffi and it's a somewhat low workload class, especially if you already have experience with CAD. If you don't have experience, then the labs may take you a bit longer to complete. I didn't have CAD experience and I found the labs somewhat ok after asking for help from my GSI and friends. There aren't any midterms/tests but the final was tough. People who do have CAD experience find the class fairly easy so it depends on your background. I recommend going to lab sections if you need help.
Ok, thank you!
Ok, thank you!"
Questions about Summer Classes (and upper div classes) (first time using Reddit) - Continuing 2nd Year Chemistry Major,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13wduvv/questions_about_summer_classes_and_upper_div/,2023-05-30 22:56:58,"Hi everyone. This is my **first time using Reddit**. 

I am a **continuing second year chemistry major** at the College of Chemistry. I have some questions about the summer classes and classes in the future I should enroll in. 

For the fall semester, I am currently enrolled in Chem 12A, Math 54 (with Zvezdelina Stankova) and Physics 7B (with Alessandra Lanzara). I am going to be in Berkeley this summer due to my research group commitments and I am interested in taking either Math 54 or Physics 7B this summer. My questions are as follows:

1. I have heard rumors that summer classes are **graded more generously** or have easier material and easier exams than fall/spring classes. **Is this true?**
2. **Taking into account the professors who will be teaching these classes in the fall semester**, which would you take over the summer: Math 54 or Physics 7B? 
3. Since I am already enrolled in Math 54 and Physics 7B for the fall semester, **I would need to replace one of them with a 3 or 4 unit upper division chemistry class.** This upper div chem class would have to not require previous knowledge of whichever course I take during the fall. For instance, if I take physics 7B during the fall, the upper div chem class should not have Physics 7B as a prerequisite. One example of this situation is the fact that **Chem 120A lists Physics 7B and Math 54 as prerequisites**. Therefore, I cannot take Chem 120A during the fall semester. I'm planning on taking Chem 104A and 104B during my junior year (3rd year). Does anyone have any recommendations for a 3 or 4 unit upper div chem class that would be a **good first upper div chem class** other than Chem 104A and Chem 120A? 
4. On the [official Chemistry Major Program chart](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/ugrad/degrees/chem#chart), it says a chemistry major must complete 12 units of **Chem Electives and Allied Subjects.** I read the [official web wage](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/ugrad/degrees/chem/upper-courses) about it and it is still confusing to me. Does anyone have experience with this? 

Thank you very much for the help.","1. Depend on the class. Some classes are graded easier because the class moves 2x faster so it’s harder to grasp. In my experience, summer is easier.
2. Math 54 over the summer at a CC to save money + enjoy the summer. 

3 & 4. It looks like you would need prereqs for most  upper div courses. You should replace 54 or 7B with an elective/ allied subject. You can find a list of these classes that count here: https://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/chemistry/#majorrequirementsbsdegreetext. Based on what you’ve said: Bio 100, Civ Eng 106 & 111, Eps 103 & C129 and Mcellbi C100A would all count and you should have all the prereqs done for them."
Rate Schedule of Freshman Applied Math Major hoping to switch to DS,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/152in8r/rate_schedule_of_freshman_applied_math_major/,2023-07-17 17:11:15,"&#x200B;

[Obviously I know the 8AM's are horrible, but I couldn't get out of it unfortunately. The timing gap also feels like it would get a bit annoying but was wondering what people's thoughts were on the classes. I'm also confused why there's discussion and lecture for Math 54, is it really meeting 6 times a week? For reference, I have taken 3 CS classes at my CC and multivariable calculus. ](https://preview.redd.it/rcarmxa08mcb1.png?width=1980&format=png&auto=webp&s=f879c18ac9b445b4c8298cde644b610a7129da72)","Ok you are taking cs70 and math 54 with stankova... you're gonna die blud :sob:
Unless you were in AMC or USAMO, I don’t see any good reason to take CS 70 so soon. It’s the major outlier in your scheduling. Take a breadth or R&C class instead.
Yes, 6 hr/wk is typical for lower div math!
wow this is death

truly why would anyone subject themselves to this 

especially cs70 as an intended DS major
professor plum, amc(10/12) and usamo are part of the same program (math olympiad) and differ vastly in difficulty"
Is this a reasonable first semester schedule? Intended Data Science major,https://i.redd.it/dqtfzkcm57bb1.png,2023-07-10 13:29:10,,"I would say this schedule is 3 techs and not recommend it unless you’re fully prepared to dedicate most of your semester to grinding. If it’s your first semester, I’d recommend taking 2 techs at max mainly to 

1) get acclimated to cal academics -wise 

2) meet people and hang out etc 

Lmk if you have more Qs
i would definitely push back math 54 to focus on data 8 & cs 61a

math 54 is not easy for most and the 61a&data8 combo is pretty busy
You’re good but it’s on the heavier side. There’s the 10m berkeley time. Wheeler and Li Ka Shing is kinda far but Dwinelle and Wheeler is close
LKS to Dwindelle is an end zone to end zone TD run. So a walk is a few minutes at most. But from LKS to Wheeler, it’s about 4x to 5x farther. Stankova (math) will keep you very busy but you also learn a lot in her class. 53 not needed for 54. Data 8 will be mostly busy work but not as difficult. CS 61a is a big weeder class… very helpful to read up ahead… https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/archives.html

As most here would warn… taking more than 2 techs on your very first semester is risky. You’ll have plenty of time get these courses done. Could unload 1 tech to get acclimated, meet people, and join clubs.
Hi! I'm a incoming freshman who is intending to declare Data Science. I was just wanted to get some advice from past students on if this schedule would be too difficult for my first semester. Specifically, I've gotten a 5 on Calc BC but I haven't learned multivariable calculus (Math 53), so I was wondering if Math 54 would be too big of a jump. I've also taken AP CS and AP Stats. Also, would it be hard to get to each class on time if they're back to back? Thanks in advance!!
i did math 54/61a/anthro 3ac/bioe 10 my first sem and that was maxing myself out - if you have a good background in cs/math/ds, then this should be plenty doable. if you’re like me and this’ll be your first cs class or your first hard math class, it may be a bit too much
CS 61A is rough. If you’re good at programming the workload is easy-moderate, but the tests are hell.

Math 54 is tough like any math class, but there are certainly worse ones around (1B, 53, 104, COMPSCI 70). The material isn’t the worst, but it’s not a joke either. The workload during the semester should be ok, it’s a bit much over the summer.

Data C8 I haven’t taken, but if it’s anything like STAT 20 it’s pretty easy. It still requires a bit of work though. And it might be harder than STAT 20; hard to say.

Sociology 3AC is probably fine. I would pass no pass it.

Your overall workload is completely fine if you’re good at math and CS and don’t take on too many extracurriculars. With clubs and research it might get tough.
I would echo earlier comment on 3 techs at least for first sem. Also is there a reason ur taking 61A and not 88 if u know ur data science. 88 covers all the important parts of 61A while being less intensive and I was just as prepared for 61B compared to peers who took 61A
Contrary to what some other comments are saying, I think this is a reasonable schedule.

This was basically my schedule for my first semester (though I didn't take Sociology 3AC), and it was fine. In fact, most of the semester was just spent idling around to be honest.

For reference, I went into 61A after only taking APCSA my last semester of senior year, and had no prior experience for Math 54. For Data 8, I had already taken AP Stats and APCSA.

In terms difficulty for your techs, I would say 61A > M54 > D8.

For 61A, the coursework itself should be guaranteed full points if you are on top of things. The main concern would be exams, as the difficulty for exams is way higher than coursework; make sure to grind A LOT of practice exams early.

For Math 54, the proofs can get tricky at times, but it isn't too bad to be honest. I would recommend to maybe read ahead a bit and have a good grasp of the concepts as they are very interconnected.

For Data 8, the class is honestly free if you have prior experience in APCSA and AP Statistics. Stats will be very helpful for the probability section and also some stuff like hypothesis testing/confidence intervals/etc. The ""coding"" done in the class is also very straightforwars; it is mostly just knowing their custom DS Python Library and remembering the different tests.

Best of luck with your studies🫡
Depending on how strong in math/CS you are, this isn't the worst schedule imo. I'd recommend just doing the 3 techs just so that you can get them out of the way for other tech classes next sem + slightly lighter courseload. You can do CSM for a PNP unit to get to the 13 unit threshold. I did math1b + data 8 + 61a fall sem and it was ok!
I took a very similar course load my first semester and I was okay; but I don’t recommend it. Try to stick to 2 techs max first semester, and ease into it.
Reasonable for a first semester freshman? No.

Doable? Yes, but either you have a very strong math/coding background or you’re willing to give up any social life.
I think your sched is fine, depending on your academic background.  As an anecdotal example, my kid skipped Calc and did 61A/Data 8/EECS16A his first semester, and although he’s a smart guy from a very competitive HS, I wouldn’t really consider him to be a brilliant student by any means if I’m honest. Didn’t get all A’s but he did fine and he had plenty of time for basketball and activities. 

The one thing I will say is that you should seriously consider what your domain emphasis is going to be.  Some domains, like Business Analytics or Cognition, the first class will cover your Social Sciences breadth. So taking Sociol 3A may be a waste if taking a breadth is what your intention was.  Being a DS major will probably cover 3 of your 7 breadths if you plan things right.  If you’re going to take a breadth, take a Arts & Literature breadth - chances are no domain emphasis class will double dip that breadth.
How many units is that? I would not go over 15 but tbh I’d stick to just 13 especially 1st sem
if you took ap stats and have any kind of programming experience, data 8 is less work than most breadths. I wouldn't get too scared off by the whole ""3 techs"" thing.

I would consider this an ""average"" schedule, not a particularly difficult one.
Yeah this schedule should be fine

I see white space on your schedule so you’re likely not doing enough 👍
Why take CS61A? I guess if you have prior coding experience then it's okay. You're going to have an exam like 2 weeks into the semester
intended DS major here - depends on what you consider difficult. am personally glad I took D8 first sem & 61A the next, to get a feel for how hard courses would be here. nice breadth & American Cultures in one.
This would involve sitting indoors for 90% of the day, unless you're willing to study outside :)
Looks fine to me. Just keep in mind that CS61A and Math 54 are sophomore level classes, and they will be significantly harder than Data C8. Sociology 3AC is an American Cultures class, so it will likely be really easy (think standard high school class easy)
+1, i completely lost out on doing clubs, going out as much, and overall a sense of adjusting to college life bc i was just juggling 2 techs and 2 breadths (which eventually becomes a norm but was a bit too heavy for me my first sem). i strongly recommend taking a slightly easier courseload than you think you can handle just so that you can pursue other interests/make friends/apply to and join clubs
Thank you for the reply! I def dont want to overload myself first semester, would you recommend pushing back 61a or math 54 to second semester? I was thinking of taking 61b and math 54 together 2nd sem but that also sounds pretty tough.
Hi, i’m doing data c8, data c88, and mcb c100a. 

would this be considered 3 techs?
data 8 is a very light tech, I think this is fine tbh.

obviously depends on the person though
This depends a lot on the person/their background. I took 4 techs my first semester and I was fine academically and I had a ton of time to meet people and hang out (nevermind that I mostly spent it watching anime and playing LoL).
huh aren’t dwinelle and wheeler right by each other?
Thats the usual path for people who take BC so you’ll be fine. And every class operates by Berkeley time (starts 10 minutes after listed time) so having back to back classes is doable. But make sure to factor in some time to eat within your schedule
I think c8 and math 54 wouldnt be too hard for you! However, like everyone else says, 3 tech is time consuming, esp with cs61 series which is just a pain overall for everyone. It might not be particularly hard, but it's definitely a grind. Just choose any 2 of those and you should be fine! If you're you wanna take cs61a, then take an easy breadth with it. If you dont wanna take 61a, you can go for another breadth that you are interested in but might take more time out of you.
Your schedule is ambitious but totally doable imo. I think for Data Science, it is the right call to take 54 before 53 as linear algebra is very important. I would rather over commit the first semester than under commit and be bored. Back to back classes are my preference. The Cal campus is small so you should be totally able to go between the classes without issue. I hate small breaks in my schedule since I find that they are not very useful.
I don't really have a good reason haha, I was just interested in the material that 61a covers. Do you think taking 88 would be better than 61a?
Maybe you were just particularly good, but C88 does not prepare you the way 61A does. OP will have to take 61B, and likely two upper division CS courses + CS 189 at some point. It’s best to prepare with 61A imo.
no do premed instead
61b+54 is fine, good blend of project and pset actually
Not a mcb major, but c100a is considered difficult 😥
I don’t know anything about bio or mcb etc but most stem classes would be classified as a “tech”
Transfer student?
Yes but across a open space.
I took another look at your schedule. Wheeler to Dwinelle is no problem as they are right next to each other. I went between those exact 2 rooms in the reverse order this spring without any issue. Li Ka Shing to Wheeler isn't bad either
Take 61a and keep ur options open, you will learn more too
0.0.. Might have to reconsider my schedule. Not sure if its doable now. Ill try to lighten it up with some summer classes and cc classes. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NGukdXbrzaiBRT9z04bOfLVWWtZT46HIN6CeEsfmTlA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NGukdXbrzaiBRT9z04bOfLVWWtZT46HIN6CeEsfmTlA/edit?usp=sharing) Though I have a question, If I do spread my classes out further, my semesters will only have 8 units of my required classes. What do I take to reach 13 units for full time status?
alright thanks!!
Yup, I am now rethinking my schedule as double major in mcb and data science. Maybe ill just take some cc classes for linear algebra and data 8. That should lighten the load for sure. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NGukdXbrzaiBRT9z04bOfLVWWtZT46HIN6CeEsfmTlA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NGukdXbrzaiBRT9z04bOfLVWWtZT46HIN6CeEsfmTlA/edit?usp=sharing)  
that's my schedule idk if u know anything about those classes?   


Ill try to add some summer classes to lighten the load more i guess. Though I have a question, If I do spread my classes out further, my semesters will only have 8 units of my required classes. What do I take to reach 13 units for full time status?
It’d add like 30 seconds to the walk at most
Agreed! Same courses but who knows you might wanna change to cs major 🤷‍♀️
It’s actually doable. Just got to stay focus and on top of your workload and schedule. C8 is mostly busy work. C88 is CS61a lite.

Your spring schedule is more difficult because of cs61b. By mid-fall you’ll gauge better on how you can handle spring schedule.
>alright thanks!!

You're welcome!
1. You should have taken linear at CC. If not, you won't be able to until next summer before doing Data 100 in the next fall.
2. As a transfer, you are expected to take 3 techs every semester since both of your major are tech.
3. I highly recommend that you take a couple of courses in Berkeley Summer like Upper Div American Culture and maybe Data 100.
its gonna be basically impossible now with the recent changes
Thanks so much!! Yea I should be able to gauge my workload by then"
