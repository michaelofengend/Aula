Shewchuk Controversy vs Peyrin Kao Irony,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bjayfe/shewchuk_controversy_vs_peyrin_kao_irony/,2024-03-20 04:14:02,"I just think it's funny how last semester, Peyrin Kao spoke out about Palestine (literal genocide that's being excused by this zionist school & a very important discussion) and that was deemed as unnecessary by the EECS department and made into a big deal--almost causing him his job... but when Shewchuk makes a sexist and weird comment on an Ed feed, that just leads to a quick lil meeting with the EECS department and we're back to business? This school needs to get its priorities straight smh. I just think this circumstance is ironic in relation to how Kao was treated, and should be properly handled...and I think Shewchuk's apology isn't adequate enough. I also think it sucks women in that class have to feel uncomfortable due to his comments generalizing women and their ""ability to be dated"" and I really hope his behavior towards his female students isn't translated from this comment he made. And I also think Ed should stop being a place to make weird comments about non-educational, personal issues...and I thought that was common sense but I guess not?? Professors shouldn't be responding with their personal opinions on girls...it's just really weird, and I think it's weird if you don't think that. Keep an academic environment academic, period. 

Edit: I obviously know Shewchuk is tenured and Kao is not...but it still shows that there is an unfortunate power dynamic in relation to academia, free speech, and its consequences. 

ALSO, I also don't think Shewchuk should lose his job...cancel culture is toxic and I think in this case, it's more about understanding students' concerns and not normalizing this behavior. Trying to ruin someone's life due to one mistake is wrong and I don't like that people try to hurt someone over one mistake...the point is to better oneself and understand students' perspectives so he doesn't do it again. This was one account of his behavior and I have not heard of him doing harm to students besides this odd comment, so I don't think it's right to ruin someone's career over one mistake they make, that's distasteful. ","Why did the sub icon change???
John Yoo wrote the Bush administration torture memos and Berkeley can’t fire him for that, tenure is powerful
Tenured faculty vs early career lecturer. Huge difference in what the university is able to do. Doesn't indicate a misplacement of priorities.
Payrin Kao is a lecturer. Shewchuk is senate. Even if they did the exact same thing, Shewchuck would likely face fewer consequences.
This is not over yet; just wait
This sub needs to get is priorities straight. He apologized and acknowledged it was an inappropriate comment. What else do you want to happen? You want this guy fired and have his life ruined for that comment? People are acting like he was outed as a Nazi or something. This is just a weird revenge fetish at this point

Not genocide.
I hear you. Its crap
Tenured professor versus seasonal lecturer. They both broke rules, but one has much greater seniority.
OK, now here's a thread I probably shouldn't get into but yeah.  I'm getting quite angry. 

Give it a *little* bit of time. 100% it's not OK. 

  
And look, I *know* that Central Campus admins read this sub -- that's in no small part why Peyrin got a talking to. So those same folks better be putting similar pressure on COE and EECS, and frankly helping overworked faculty who care try to make things better. :)
[deleted]
Get a job
It's pretty simple. Berkeley does not care about its students. Berkeley cares about Zionist donors.
Tenured professors are, well, tenured. It's much harder to fire them unless they explicitly break laws. 
Also, there is no genocide whatsoever, using this term is antisemitic because it is meant specifically to diminish the significance of the Holocaust. Kao hijacked class time to spread false propaganda.
""but when Shewchuk makes a sexist... comment on an Ed feed...""

Shewchuk did not make a sexist comment on Ed.
A) The comment wasn't sexist

B) Shewchuk is a tenured professor and preeminent researcher in his field, Kao is just some random lecturer
Bros asking the real questions🙏
John Yoo did a good job with that too. He's got experience and thats what we should want.
Yeah Shewchuk is basically flexing tenure at this point. Remember why Weaver and Fox left? No tenure.
This is not a one-on-one he-said, she-said conflict.  Lecturer is simply voicing the argument of an offended class.  Punitive measures are rarely the best remedy; a clear statement from somewhere in UC management regarding professional conduct on social media by all UC employees would suffice, with the closing message being: if you make a mess, clean it up.  This should not need committee meetings or hearings...but maybe I am naive?
It's not about who is tenured vs who is not...it's about the principle and how Berkeley thought standing up for human rights was wrong and in this case, making a weird sexist comment will simply be brushed off.
From your lips to God's ears. That asshat should be fired.
It's really disturbing how quickly people on these threads jump to getting Shewchuk fired. Events like these are really good case studies in group think.
Whatever, Shewchuk.
You’re being downvoted because you don’t understand how academia works. He’s a piece of shit for saying that but he shouldn’t and won’t be fired. He either should be disallowed to teach (without going through serious training) but I feel like that’s more of a reward than anything for professors
Ever heard of freedom of speech?

The definition contained in Article II of the UN Convention describes genocide as **a crime committed with the intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, in whole or in part**. It does not include political groups or so called “cultural genocide”.  Hamas, the target of the Israeli offensive, is a political organization.
I am also confused. Did they not receive the same punishment? 

Peyrin got a talking to and kept his courses.
Shewchuk got a talking to and is still slotted for his courses.

Both talked about unacademic things in an academic setting and hurt the feelings of certain groups. 

Although Peyrin might have been on thinner ice, that’s just because he isn’t tenured. Either way no real difference in punishment right?
womp womp, mad bc someone didn't want to stay silent about genocide when it affects so many students personally and relates to tech companies that support the funding of genocide? also sherlock, it was at the end of class and people could leave, so it didn't take up any class time:)
You're not getting one with a data science major in this economy that's for sure🥰
What's wrong with being a Zionist?
[deleted]
Maybe research anti-semitism vs zionism buddy. Hope this helps your uneducated self:))) If you think the holocaust is wrong, how are you fine with what's happening in Palestine??? All talk and no proper brain cells.
Judging by your history, it seems like you’re out of touch. LMAO
Okay incel.
Just some random lecturer?
The weird sexist comment is grounds for a TA or lecturer to be fired (less likely in the latter case). It's only brushed off because Shewchuk is tenured faculty. Notice that tenured EECS professors have made public statements about the war without suffering any consequences. It's a matter of privilege and power. I'm not justifying this, only explaining it.
It’s honestly embarrassing this is the mindset of Berkeley students now. Just this whole idea that anybody saying anything out of line in anyway whatsoever should have their lives ruined and income taken away immediately is insane. He already apologized and acknowledged it was an inappropriate comment. There are professors with far worse beliefs than this that won’t even back track on it. Do you really want a school with professors terrified of saying anything because their livelihoods will be attacked if they upset students in anyway? People need to be allowed to say stupid shit sometimes
It's really fucking disturbing that some people still don't understand why this is a fireable offense.
Ironic isn’t it that this sub has been supporting terrorist sympathizers and nazis to the hilt and now they are furious about some ill judged yet minor incel comments
[deleted]
You clearly don't understand how that works.

The issue is it requires intent. Israel may be callous about civilians, but they’re not killing civilians on purpose.
Punishment in both cases is actually hard to quantify. But in the (many) faculty guidelines and bylaws, the actions are not equivalent. Tenure is powerful, but discipline is possible. 

There was a message sent to all 61B students by the dept after Peyrin's speech. At least the same should happen here. But I will give that some time. This is possibly one of the busiest times for the dept absent any existential crises.
Damn this hurts my soul😭
Already have a well paid one lined up, dw
[removed]
Zero equivalence whatsoever. 6 million Jews were systematically exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers. Merely this comment proves that you are nothing but a flaming antisemite.
I don't think ""out of touch"" is the right way to put it. I'm very aware of the opinions of other people on campus, I just happen to disagree with some of them.
Incel as in ""involuntarily celibate""?
Kao got his Masters two years ago.

Shewchuk has done decades of respected high quality research and has excellent student reviews.

Kao is a random lecturer.
Yes. My time at Berkeley perfectly coincided with Peyrin's and while I never interacted directly with Peyrin, I was a GSI myself so shared a number of channels with Peyrin. By all accounts that I have seen, Peyrin is a fantastic lecturer and overall teacher, and is very popular with students. But from the university's/department's perspective, Peyrin is a completely replaceable cog in the machine. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if lecturers like Peyrin are on year-to-year contracts, with effectively no job security.

This in contrast to a well-known professor who has multiple decades of research and teaching experience. I'm not saying one's comments were better or worse than the other's. I'm saying that their relative backgrounds explain the differences in how their situations were treated.
I think there is a misplacement of priorities in the sense that speaking up about genocide at Berkeley is not allowed by a lecturer...a supposedly ""activist"" school-- why are we supposed to stay silent?? This school brags about being the start of the civil rights movement and activism yet this is somehow not deemed okay?? Weird.
It’s a whole professor saying it. Plus, this apology was a huge excuse saying that he feels sorry that you feel that way. He has taken no accountability for his actions. Professors SHOULD be wary of what they say because they are constantly around impressionable students who look up to them. He sets an example for students and if he says stupid shit, students are going to be doing the exact same thing. Duh, use ur brain.
Maybe you could explain it to us?
Yeah you get the point, you are expressing yourself and wont get fired by no body. Same applies to the CS prof.
tell me about it then
Alumni is plural. You also referred to yourself as a woman, so that would be an odd choice even if you were correct.

Nobody on either side has a good record of protecting civilians, unfortunately.
if you ""accidentally"" kill over 10k children and 26k civillians, at what point do we start questioning their intentions lol
There is a ton of evidence that they are doing exactly that
they’ve literally said they’re willing to kill as many civilians as needed to achieve this aka intent to kill civilians.
Not for long bestie

People are being brutally murdered in front of your own eyes in inhumane ways, mirroring these same incidents that the Nazis did to Jewish individuals, and this is your take? 30,000 people have died in just a few months, and mostly children. You are a hypocrite...I'm not an anti-semite but you are a zionist. How sad that when the same thing starts happening to another religious group, you turn away and forget what happened to people from your own religion.
You can be in touch, but are you socially aware enough to understand? If so many students are coming out and saying that it’s sexist, you obviously are missing an important point, aren’t you?
Yes🥰
Your first 2 sentences are factual. 

However a position of authority or respect does not entitle that person to make generalized defamatory statements about the female population in the Bay Area.

Also can you name one piece of research he has done without searching it up? 

Since you are familiar with his decades of respected high quality research.
Who cares??? It's not about position and power, it's about the comments people make. Your ignorance will bite you in the ass one day when your voice will be silenced by someone who is of a higher ""position or status"" as it happens to so many people in society constantly. What matters is how we should pay attention to the privilege someone has to make these weird comments and someone who is not tenured simply cannot have a voice at all.
I agree with you
If you are aware of the history of the FSM, you would know that the administration did not like it much. Nowadays, they'll flaunt the FSM on campus tours or in brochures but at the end of the day they're still the administration. Protections of free speech generally only apply to students, not to faculty/people employed by the university. Unless you have tenure, which some think shouldn't exist.
If you are a college student and your entire world view can be changed by a dumb mildly sexist comment on a EECS discussion forum you have bigger issues going on. Being exposed to views you disagree with or even find contemptible is a part of any well rounded education and of becoming a well adjusted adult. Creating an environment where professors have to think twice about every word out of their mouth in case students decide to try to get them fired if they disagree with them would be the death of academia. 

The fact you won’t accept an apology no matter what and want an environment where professors aren’t allowed to say anything that upsets a single student without being fired is just proving my point. There are so many truly terrible people in the world this is a ridiculous hill to die on. We have a professor that doesn’t believe aids is real and is blatantly homophobic but this is what students want someone to be fired over.

What do you think should happen exactly? You want him fired? You think he should be banned from academia for this comment? Prison sentence? An apology and acknowledgment that this was inappropriate behavior for a professor is clearly not enough so please explain what you think the proper outcome should be.
you're so self-righteous and performative it's disgusting. is your life really so shit that you get off so hard on trying to get the prof canned over something this small? i cant fathom how people like you exist, it's clearly all about you and how you're such a great person for demanding ""justice"" or however ur deranged brain works. i guess you've never done anything wrong in your miserable life or you conveniently have excuses for each of them to somehow relieve you of culpability through some simone biles level mental gymnastics. 

he said something, he apologized. move on w ur life or go start a brigade against the resident crackhead bc he doesnt understand microaggression or something. i dont even go to this school and im so glad i dont if people like u make up most of it
Just bc you have freedom of speech doesn't mean there aren't consequences🫶

Hamas said themselves they have lost around [6,000](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-six-week-drive-hit-hamas-rafah-scale-back-war-2024-02-19/) militants. Israel has claimed they have killed 12,000. If we use the middle ground of around 9,000 Hamas dead we can infer this is a legit military operation and not a genocide. A 1:3 combat ratio is very good for urban warfare especially in one of the most population dense areas in the middle east. 

Genocide has become such a throwaway term for this war and it’s pretty disgraceful.
Willing to kill civilians to achieve a third goal isn’t the same as intending to kill civilians.
That's not how to read that...and you know better...why go there?  You have plenty of good and real arguments on your side, just not history.  I'm sorry for both sides having the leadership they have.
Hahaha u wish
Jk I'm data science 🥲💔
I'm most definitely a Zionist. This is a war, war is ugly, urban warfare is even worse - and among those 30K dead there are at least 12K Hamas members, even according to them. So this is in fact a better accuracy than NATO or the US army ever achieved. Not a genocide, and any false equivalence you're trying to draw to the Holocaust is out of pure antisemitism.
If you assume that it's impossible to simultaneously understand the opinions of other people and yet disagree with them, then yes, I think it would be fair to say I was ""missing an important point."" But I don't think that's a fair assumption. I also don't think that things become more true as more people repeat them, so.
ok
> Also can you name one piece of research he has done without searching it up?

I actually can.  Took classes from him years ago.  Hung out with him socially a few times.  I read a comment recently on here ""the dude dresses like The Joker"" (very accurate).  go look up his CV - it's very impressive.  He's obsessed with triangle meshes.  I Googled him after reading your comment.  I guess he's pivoted to Machine Learning, like everyone else.
Yes, the core part of learning to be an adult is to experience different opinions but not when it comes to basic human decency and not when it comes from people in authority. When students view professors negatively, they do not believe that their opinions can be addressed on the same level as a peer. You portray that same way of thinking when you bring up the homophobic professor. When peers bring up different opinions, you believe that you can change them. It is not the same with people of authority. 

And thank you for bringing up his apology, which wasn’t a sincere one at all. And you’re wrong, I would accept an apology, but a real one. Nothing that he wrote in there accepted accountability or reflection on his actions, it was more of a “whatever, sorry” than anything else. He needs to actually face his actions and take accountability. 

Also, comparing two wrongs doesn’t make a right. Just because this professor isn’t AS BAD as another doesn’t make him good. If this professor is dealt with accordingly for his actions, it sets an example for the future. 

Duhh, don’t write things that you can’t wholeheartedly defend. And if you think that his apology is a good one, then you obviously have been mistreated thru life because that was a joke of a response lmaoooo

if cops were targeting hostile gang operations here at home, in no world is a 1:3 ratio an acceptable outcome. what an insane thing to say. just say you dont care about palestinian civilians
if i specifically say I’m willing to do something, it basically means I’m intending to do it…
Pain
Ew what is wrong with you?? You're trying to compare the number of people that died?? It doesn't matter the number in comparison you incel...people are being killed. You are the definition of hypocricy.
Cool ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)
I never said that, I’m pointing out the irony of students wanting this guy fired when nobody is up and arms getting Duedberg fired for far more contemptible views.  

He apologized and said he recognized it was not appropriate, but you decide he doesn’t mean it because you want blood.

Why won’t you say what you think “accepting accountability” means? Do you think he should be fired? Or worse? What do you think the just outcome for this situation is? Tons of people saying this isn’t acceptable outcome but nobody seems to have the guts to say what they think should happen to him for this. 

And don’t tell me I’ve “obviously been mistreated in life” just because I am not delusional enough to think ruining someone’s life over this is justice or makes you look like a good person.
Being fired after gaining tenure at a university is basically a death sentence in academia. He doesn't really have other options. However, being stripped of tenure usually happens in very extreme cases e.g. when a professor has committed a violent crime or has repeatedly been negligent of their job (an example of this happening is if they refuse to show up to teach). I have never heard of a professor being outright fired for making disparaging and discriminatory statements. At worst, Shewchuk won't teach a class again. But this is also unlikely given EECS staffing limitations.
[deleted]
Just say you don’t understand war. UN says that 1:9 is combatant to civilian death toll average in urban warfare. Essentially, Israel is winning this war decisively while avoiding the death toll of a typical modern day war. It’s like pro Palestinians hear about dead civilians and just decide to turn off the left side of their brain.

Also bffr there is no way you just said fighting gang members in Berkeley is any way comparable to an
Iranian-backed proxy thats 45,000 strong. Your smarter then that.
Not true at all lol
I am comparing the number and the intent. The Holocaust is the most mechanical and most well documented genocide in history, and your smearing of its memory is deplorable.
Hey, the only person saying that his life should be ruined is you. All I’m asking for is a real apology. A real one would, as stated before, take accountability. It should state the fallacies of his comment and rebuke them. That’s what a real apology is, not some off hand attempt at sympathy. 

Also, why are you so vehemently defending him? Shouldn’t you also be glad that he’s facing some sort of consequences for his actions so that professors can also face fair consequences? 

Would you be happy with a homophobic professor’s joke of a apology? It isn’t irony to target new issues, you can support more than one cause at a time by the way.
Are you trolling or actually dumb? What you quoted directly contradicts your claim.
tell me youre still a teenager without telling me lol. this didnt start on october 7. what about all the civilians bombed during operations returning echo, protective edge, etc? and what about all the palestinians who die from hunger, cold, and disease? israel controls gazan water supplies, roads, power grids, etc. is this a war or a one sided bombing with total impunity? i've been to the west bank, where there isn't any hamas presence, yet I witnessed israelis, protected by idf agents, steal people's home in broad daylight. there was no war there, yet israel executed several teenage boys like you a few neighborhoods over for throwing rocks. I think about 1 in every 3 men i spoke to had been to an israeli jail for longer than three days. that is what i call a genocidal occupation.
Literally nobody is smearing its memory. You are smearing what is happening in Palestine...do you even hear how hypocritical you are? What a weird victim, narcissistic complex.
I’m literally saying the exact opposite of that what are you talking about lol. He did apologize, he said sorry and he said he recognized that was inappropriate behavior by him. How is that not taking accountability? He did what you said should happen, but you are saying that wasn’t enough. So what do you want? You want to draft up an apology for him that sufficiently grovels to you personally? And if he doesn’t give a second apology that you personally find acceptable based on your personal feelings what should happen? You want him fired?

I’m not defending his comment at all in anyway. I’ve said numerous times it was an inappropriate statement. I agree with you about that. A professor should not make a comment like that especially on a class discussion forum. But he has apologized and we still have people like you asking for his head on a pike. How is this confusing for you. People shouldn’t face harsh consequences for every mistake they make in life no matter how minor.

You aren’t supporting other issues. There are 0 posts about getting Duesberg fired. Nobody mentioned it once until I just did. You have never spoken about it at all.

He fucked up, said something stupid and inappropriate for a professor in a discussion section, then he apologized. That should be the end of it unless he does something like that again. Move on with your life and find something that actually matters to take your anger out on
[deleted]
> tell me youre still a teenager without telling me lol.

Either this is massive projection or you're really dumb for an adult LMAO. The only people I see suck off Palestine this hard are zoomers so the fact that you're doing it as an adult is even more embarassing.
I have not once said the Holocaust wasn't an atrocity?? So why is that every Zionist's argument when they're hit with facts? Clown behaviorrrr
Again, it’s just you saying that he should be fired. It seems like you’re projecting your issues by creating made-up scenarios of a dire consequence. Please point out one time I said that he should be fired? Stop fighting an argument that you made up in your own head. 

And no, his apology isn’t sufficient. There was no critical thinking put into even a grain of his apology. It’s the most general, insincere thing that you can craft up. If an apology can be applied to multiple general scenarios, it isn’t sufficient. 

Also, stop trying to play a hero by bringing up a homophobic professor. Where were your efforts before this too? Awareness goes both ways. 

Stop projecting your own consequences and fighting a point that you made up yourself. All I’m asking for is a sufficient apology that isn’t generalized and specifically opens conversation for him to reflect on his actions. Idk why you keep on pushing the agenda of firing him when I’ve literally never said that.
A **group** of mixed gender. As in more than one. As in plural. How are you a college-educated adult? My God.
The definition contained in Article II of the UN Convention describes genocide as **a crime committed with the intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, in whole or in part**. It does not include political groups or so called “cultural genocide”.

Hamas, the target of the Israeli offensive, is a political organization.

You use the word improperly, intentionally.  This might make you feel your argument is more effective, it is not.
How can you be a real person lol. I have not said that once. I’ve repeatedly said the opposite. You repeatedly hint at that being the outcome but don’t have the guts to just say it. Just go look in this very thread, multiple people have said word for word he should be fired. There are multiple other threads with people saying the same thing. 

You say an apology isn’t sufficient, you say more needs to be done, but you want to sit here and deny you want him fired. Just answer the question. What should happen? What does his apology need to be for you to think that’s acceptable? What specifically about his apology makes it mean nothing to you? Can you quote the part you are upset about and give an example of what you think would be acceptable? You just want to make this about you and if you don’t personally find his apology good enough it doesn’t count when that’s not how the world works. He did apologize. He did say sorry. He did recognize that the comment was inappropriate for him to make. Those are verifiable facts. 

I’m not playing a hero, that’s what you are pretending to do. I’m not the one saying he needs to be punished for this. I don’t even necessarily think Duesberg should be fired but there’s a WAY stronger argument he should be than this guy. The point of bringing that up was to illustrate you don’t actually care about his beliefs. You just saw a Reddit post about this and want mob justice and to feel good about yourself. You don’t actually care enough to even be aware of professors with contemptible views at Berkeley until it’s a trendy topic to complain about on the internet.
[deleted]
They aren't attacking Hamas buddy, after all of these innocent children and civilians have been brutally killed, and these IDF soldiers openly mock them...they are actually trying to kill every Palestinian so that they can hide that they were the ones that ousted the Palestinian people from their own land so that they can pretend like it's theirs. Watch the news. Who is the one literally attacking hospitals and refuge centers while Israeli people go about life normally while Palestinians are dying and hungry?
It’s crazy because I’m wondering the same thing about how you’re a real person. I’m still wondering if you’re rage bait or something… anyways, I have not hinted anything. I have stated clearly, over and over again, that I was a sufficient apology. Stop trying to project your made-up inner argument to antagonize my points and create a false narrative. 

Just because you’ve seen other people calling for him to be fired, I haven’t. In both of my posts, I haven’t said once that he should be fired. Just because other people have said it, doesn’t mean it applies in my case. 

Now to address his apology, point out one statement that is specific to his own situation and NOT something that can be applied to any other situation about sexism. Be realistic, his apology is the most general thing ever. He doesn’t mention his view, address it and say why it was wrong, he had to BE EXPLAINED TO ab what was wrong with this statement. Even then, none of the explanation on what was wrong about his comment is stated. 

Again, wrapping around, stop weaponizing other causes to try and take away from one. What other posts have you made against the homophobic professor before this? The only reason you brought him up was to take away from people calling out Shewchuk.
You are objectively wrong and resorting to personal attacks.
Actually, even CNN pundits state the ratio of Hamas killed to civilians killed is far better than we did in WWII, Korea, Vietnam or Afghanistan, buddy.
""Killing Hamas"" involves killing all of these innocent civilians and bombing them constantly? Yeah right
Ah so in other words you want him punished for his opinion that dating is better outside the Bay Area unless he changes his opinion about that. You don’t care that he said something that wasn’t appropriate for the setting you don’t want any professors at Berkeley that have any opinions you disagree with. That’s insane but thank you for clarifying that at least.

I’m not the one saying his apology is unacceptable. It looked like a totally normal reasonable apology for the circumstance to me. You are the one who keeps saying it isn’t acceptable and “more needs to be done” so you should be able to explain specifically what the issue with it is. But you just finally explained it’s not about the apology at all it’s about forcing him to have an opinion you deem acceptable on the matter, not about apologizing for an inappropriate statement. 

And no I literally just explained to you why I brought that up are not reading my comments or something? You are constantly dodging questions, changing the subject, twisting my words and pretending they mean something other than what i actually said.
[deleted]
Dude why is the number of civilians killed being compared?? It's so inhumane and people like you with privilege forget that innocent lives should not be lost, no matter what. And for what???
Lmaooo, It’s funny that you would say that I’m twisting your words. Address how you’re dodging the fact that I haven’t said anything about firing him, and how I have said over and over again that I want him to apologize sincerely. 

Address which parts of his apology that are specific to his particular situation, not sexism. 

Weird, huh? Also, idk how you drew that conclusion from what I said, especially since his view objectifies women. You have to see the implicit message behind his words, but I think that’ll be a bit hard for you, since you seem to accept the bare minimum. 

If the professor actually wanted to address his words, he would say how his comment was inappropriate in a teaching setting, puts women as a statistical reference, and creates a terrible view upon women as being counterparts of men. Telling someone that they should find an area where women are “plentiful” clearly objectifies them, and places the blame of a man’s singleness on women. 

None of the comment itself offered “sympathy,” as Shewchuk tried to defend himself, it pointed fingers outward, toward women. There wasn’t a comment about finding themselves, exploring the world, meeting new people, he said to go out to a place where there are more women, so that you can get one. Is this not obviously objectifying women? I cant believe that I have to explain this out to you… blink twice if you’re a real person….
You have to be trolling now.
To get rid of an army of terrorists (and their government) who started a bloody war on Israel, then ran back to hide among the populace they supposedly were trying to ""free"".  They should have reasonably anticipated the consequences; they should even now recognize the consequences, fully surrender and return the hostages.  But they like you try to win points in the media.  The longer this surrender takes, the more the people you support will die.  That clearly bothers you and me too.  Where is your appeal to Hamas to simply surrender?
Yeah you are literally just explaining why the comment was inappropriate…. Which I agree with. He apologized for making a comment that was inappropriate. Pretty sure everyone understands that’s the reason why it was a dumb comment to make and why he needed to apologize for it, which he did. But you won’t accept that because he didn’t sufficiently show he changed his mind about it. So like i said it’s not about the comment being inappropriate to make in a school setting to you it’s about his opinion itself. If he doesn’t change his opinion you apparently think he isn’t suited to be a professor. That’s a sad way to look at the world. Just because you disagree with someone about something doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be allowed to have a job as a professor and doesn’t mean you can’t learn anything from them. Every professor you’ve ever had probably has opinions you wouldn’t like. That shouldn’t be an issue if they are not voicing those opinions in an inappropriate setting, but it is an issue to you.  

And I just took a look at your profile and you literally believe you can cast magical “spells” and “shift realities” and you’re going to sit here imply I am dumb by not getting “the implicit message of his words” hahah. Which I have literally demonstrated multiple times I did anyway. Reddit is fucking amazing lol

They're fighting back because Israel literally stole their occupied land and continue to discriminate them down to their water source. Educate yourself ty
Ooh, so u wanna come after me personally after losing an argument? LMAO that’s crazy, just say you can’t address all my points. Plus I would rather have interests besides glazing a professor who doesn’t even know me. Lmk when you get off his lap LMAOOO
Also different opinions are good, but not when it comes to basic human rights. And also not when it makes students uncomfortable to be in his class. His role is supposed to teach students, not make an environment where women are seen as objects.
I love how you ninja edited your comment to remove “for the plurals,” as if it still doesn’t directly contradict your claim even without that. Are you multiple male graduates? Are you multiple gender neutral graduates?
And this forced occupation started many, many years ago. Why would they not fight back? You expect them to just continue being Israel's puppets?
Israel did not steal any land in Gaza, the West Bank, yea...but shit happens when you lose multiple wars.  There's consequences.
lol massive cope
[deleted]
It's not fighting when you have no hope of winning, it's just adults sacrificing the lives of their children.  Deal with facts.
Brush your teeth when you’re done LMAOOOO
It was initially tongue-in-cheek. You corrected someone else’s spelling in this thread, but made a mistake yourself. Then I genuinely became bewildered at how convinced you were that you were right, despite even the sources *you* cherry-picked proving you wrong. And you had the nerve to be condescending while being wrong.
There's no winner here...it's the fact that lives are being lost and that people should be able to speak up that they believe it's wrong innocent people are losing their lives (in both places). However, it's wrong to think that Israel should be trying to destroy a small country that lacks its military and financial power, as well as its allies. This is an uneven and unfair war that is costing innocent civilians their lives. Once again, there's no winner here.
Why don’t you just shift into a reality where professors are executed whenever they say something you disagree with?
[deleted]
There will be a winner, you don't get it.  Israel will drive Hamas to total unconditional surrender just like the US and allies did to Japan and Germany.  It cost a lot of mostly innocent lives to get there back then, far more (proportionately) than now.  What is less appreciated is the leadership of both Japan and Germany knew that once the US joined the war, it was slow but eventually certain death for their populace...but they did it anyway for the sake of internal politics. They poked the dragon and brought the fire...not the first or last time.  History repeats because people do not learn or think as much as they feel and want.  Both Germany and Japan surrendered to save their people even more dragon fire...but it was not ethics or humanity, it was simply that they pragmatically had no other options.  Same will happen here.  Raise, hold or fold?  Time to fold.
Why are you trying to push on your punish-a-professor kink onto me…. Literally you’re obsessed with it while I haven’t mentioned it once. Got some issues to share?
You persist in condescending despite having spent the better part of an hour vociferously defending a position that is definitively false. I don’t understand you.
[deleted]
Why is it so hard to say you were wrong? I don’t get it.
[deleted]
Yeah, clearly I’m the troll.
[deleted]
Go home troll
You’re welcome. Bye!
I am home. How am I trolling? I’ve been right the whole time, even per the sources cited by the person I was arguing with.
Ok stay there silent
Wasn’t aware I required your permission to speak.
Just a suggestion, as no one asked for your opinion
Sorry, I missed the part where literally anyone solicited your input.
You’re really hung up on this, aren’t you? Perhaps we can move on to the bigger issue here without being bogged down in semantics.
I just find it interesting that I offered a light-hearted correction to someone who did exactly the same thing to someone else and who then proceeded to insult my intelligence while unwaveringly defending a position disproven by her own sources and you then decided that somehow makes *me* a troll.
With all due respect, I don’t see you being light hearted or being respectful. You come across being hung up on minor details and being combative.
The initial correction was light-hearted. It consisted of a single word, in exactly the same manner as the correction she offered another commenter (which she herself said was also tongue-in-cheek). She then proceeded to condescend and argue her case, despite being definitively wrong. I don’t understand your reading of the situation at all.
I see why she stopped engaging with you…
Oh, you see now, do you? You Berkeley kids sure are sharp!
[deleted]
Couldn’t help yourself, could you?
[deleted]
Hope I’m not keeping you from your studies.
[deleted]
Not a life-long learner?
[deleted]
It’s not an assumption. You really aren’t very precise with language for someone of such illustrious academic pedigree.
[deleted]
Have I started it? My tone was neutral, at worst, until your smug insertion of “my dear” and condescending assertion that I’m “misinformed.” You then insisted *alumni* can be singular, which you unironically tried to support by quoting:

> Technically, alumni is the masculine plural form of the noun, but it can be used for either a group of mixed gender or a group of men.

Your point of view baffles me.
[deleted]
Yeah, you started it with the aLuMnA*??? Comments. Why don’t you spend your energy addressing the real issue at hand instead of nitpicking. You won’t, cuz you clearly have an agenda.
You could easily have cited a source that actually supports your position in the first place. Don’t know why it took you 2 hours to find one. There was already an accepted gender-neutral term (*alum*) prior to this recent push for allowing singular *alumni*, which really seems to be motivated by ignorance and stubbornness.  Using common usage as a standard, nothing is “wrong” if enough people make the same mistake. It’s not much of a standard at all.
I mirrored the way she had already corrected another commenter. How exactly is that out of bounds? It’s 1:1 what she already did. I’d love to hear what my agenda is also.
[deleted]
What a cop out. You’re a troll.
[deleted]
You an hour ago:

> Haha, ok, you have more time than me. Goodnight troll, it’s midnight.

You now: *still here*
[deleted]
Making assumptions about my circumstances now, are we? Happy your incredible education has afforded you such a comfortable life. Mine has also.
[deleted]
… says the person who bade me farewell an hour ago.
[deleted]
Glad to see you keep an open mind. That education wasn’t all lost on you. ;)
[deleted]
I would never have attended such a lowly institution. How shameless of you to condescend after struggling so hard with basic reading comprehension.
[deleted]
You’re not gifted in logical deduction. This story is all over the front page. This sub isn’t a private club. You literally supported your claim by linking to a source that explicitly refutes it and you think yourself intellectually superior. You can’t make this shit up.
[deleted]
Relevant enough you find it worth your time to respond. Just because you retired doesn’t mean you have to get a jump start on dementia.
[deleted]
You sure think awfully highly of yourself. No idea why.
[deleted]
Cute coming from someone as logically challenged as you.
[deleted]
That would sting if my ego were even 1% as fragile as yours so obviously is.
[deleted]
You seriously lack standing to make such an assessment after your earlier comments. You are Dunning-Kruger incarnate.
[deleted]
Your wit knows no bounds.
[deleted]
Thanks for noticing.
[deleted]
Kind of low-hanging fruit, so I’ll spare you and part ways. Ta-ta!

Done by me without his knowledge or input.  
Explanation at bottom about how this was transcribed. 

# Disclaimer to all students

At this point, the 61B lecture is over. If you want to go, you can. But this is actually my last lecture for the semester. Justin is lecturing the rest of the way; it's all optional fun stuff. Since this is my last chance to talk to you all, and also to those out in the recording in the world, I have a couple of things I want to say. I want to make it clear that this is only on my behalf. Like nobody on the 61B staff knows about this. No one actually knows about this, period. Like Justin, do you know what I'm about to say at all? Like I haven't told you, right? Okay.

I just wanted to leave you with some thoughts about life, and what you've learned, and what you can take forward from this class in general. That's what I want to talk about. This lecture is over, so if you want to go, you can go. You can just pretend that I have left and then I just came back, and this is a lecture hall that no one is using. Is that fair? Everyone knows the lecture is over. You can go home. I'm not here as your instructor or whatever. I'm just some guy who found an empty lecture hall and is here talking. Is that fair? Okay, I am recording this. Yeah, okay. Hopefully, it's okay with everyone. I just want to make sure.

With that in mind, again, if you want to go, leave halfway through. I don't care. Something I do want to say is, I mean, this is something I've been spending a lot of time thinking about, and something I've been spending my weekends thinking about as well.

&#x200B;

# Some context

I don't know if you all have been following the news or whatever, but there's been a situation going on in Gaza. The news stories that come out just break my heart, man. They've been bombing hospitals, they've been bombing schools, and they've been killing journalists, children, women. The thing about Gaza, which I don't know how many, you know, I had to learn as well and get informed too, but is everyone aware that in Gaza, you can't leave? This is not, ""Oh, I can just go somewhere else, whatever."" There's a blockade happening there by the Israeli government, and it means that the people inside cannot leave. There's no option to go. There's no airport to leave. There are no boats taking people out. It is a closed, open-air prison is what people are calling it because you can't leave.

That is something that I think maybe a lot of people don't realize, but I wanted to get the word out there. Something else is that, because there's this blockade, resources can't go inside either. This blockade means that the Israeli government gets to decide what goes in and out (correction: Rafah border crossing is controlled by Egypt, but Israel has cut off all humanitarian aid to Gaza from its border crossings). So they have stopped the flow of electricity. These people inside don't have power to power their hospitals or cook food. They don't have water. They don't have food. Supplies are running out. There are hospitals that just can't function because they've been bombed or because there's no electricity to support it.

The reason why I'm saying all this, by the way. I'm sorry to throw all this emotion on you, but I'll link it back to 61B and why we're all here in just a moment. I just wanted to make sure we're all aware of the situation. If you're not, literally just go on Google. The horror stories I see every day break my heart.

&#x200B;

# Qualifying my position

So, at this point, I know that people are about to come for my job. I was already told I shouldn't be doing this. Before you come for my job or whatever, I need to dispel a couple of things. I know when I'm talking to my bosses, they'll say, ""Oh, you didn't condemn Hamas,"" whatever. Hopefully, I have made it very clear that I am not in favor of bombing innocent civilians in hospitals, schools, whatever.

But I also do want to remind you all that the attacks that happened in October are not an excuse to bomb people back. That's not how that works. You don't just say, ""Oh, well, some people got bombed so I'm going to bomb them back."" That's not how that works, okay?

I also want to remind you that history did not start in October. We were here talking about Java before October. There were things that happened before the attacks in October. There's 75 years of Palestinian history of oppression, ethnic cleansing, genocide that's been happening for the past 75 years. There have been people in Palestine who've been taken political prisoner for decades and haven't been awarded a fair trial or anything at all.

So, sure, we talk about releasing the Israeli hostages, and I'm in favor of that too. But let's also, at the same time, not be afraid to talk about the Palestinian hostages who are being held by the Israeli government. Let's not be afraid to talk about the hostages who are in Gaza and cannot leave. I think that's a hostage situation too.

If anyone wants to accuse me of being a terrorist sympathizer or whatever, I want to make it very clear that I'm not, and that's not what I'm here for. If you want to also come to me, ""Oh, you're anti-Semitic and anti-Israel,"" I want to make it clear that anti-Semitism is not anti-Zionism. They are different things.

When I was out here, by the way, these are all my own photos from the past four, five weekends (showing slides containing images of local pro-Palestine demonstrations). When we are out here, I'm not standing against my Jewish brothers, sisters, and siblings, but I'm standing with them because we say that we don't want this to happen again and not in their name. I just wanted to get that out there in case I get fired or whatever. I am not sympathizing with terrorists or anything that may be interpreted that way.

&#x200B;

# Why I care about this

So, I realized I just dropped a lot of stuff on you. Now I want to bring it back to why this matters to you, why this matters to me. You might be thinking, ""Credit to you for saying this, but this isn't the only thing that's happening in the world. Why haven't you talked about anything else that's been happening?"" And you know what? Maybe you're right. But one other thing that I really want to emphasize that makes this so important to us and makes it so that this is not something that's just happening to other people in the world who are, you know, on the other side of the globe, why does it concern me? It's who is funding this.

The US is the biggest backer of Israel and its current bombing campaign in Gaza. My tax dollars are being used to fund the bombing of children, hospitals, schools, universities, safe zones. As someone who is funding this, I think I have a right to say something against it. I did not consent to using my money for this. You might say, ""Let's just go vote out the people who said this."" But who do I vote for? I look in the Senate. They're voting like 97 to 0 to give Israel more funding. In the Senate, 97 to 0 means everyone from Ted Cruz to Bernie Sanders votes for it. Do you know how hard it is to get Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders to agree on something? And they agree on this. Give me a break.

So, I think if my tax dollars are being used to fund this, and your tax dollars are being used to fund this, I think I have a right to say something about it in the space that I have. Maybe it's selfish of me to say, ""Oh, I have a space here to talk about it,"" but I think you do too. This is where I'm going to bring it back to 61B.

&#x200B;

# How this relates to you

So, what have you learned in this class? Sure, I could sit here and tell you all about, oh, we learned about a summary of sorting, we talked about priority queues, but, you know, to be realistic, are you really going to remember what radix sort is in like 10 years without looking it up? Probably not. Okay, and that's okay. I'm not offended. You know, I didn't remember what LLRB's where before I came and taught this class again, and that was like, you know, five, six years ago for me.

But what I really want you to take away from this class personally, and maybe everyone else has different opinions, and that's okay, but I think that from 61B, what you have gained is the power to be successful. I don't know how else to say this really, but you've gained the privilege to get a Berkeley degree in computer science, which is not just some crummy piece of paper. The Berkeley degree in computer science or data science is going to unlock so many opportunities and paths for you to be successful out there.

You can go out and get a software engineering job that pays twice or three times whatever the hell I make. You can go out and do consulting work or engineering and build amazing, complicated things and contribute to massive projects that change governments, change how we live as a society, change the world. Right? If you go work for a tech company, Facebook, Google, whatever, you're changing the way in which people in the world get information.

Or if you go out and work for the government or work for any of these major companies, or go out and design self-driving cars, you're changing the way that people get around or you're changing the world, really. You have been given the power to go out and use everything you've learned in this class, the ability to write all this complex code, manage the complexity, and work with other people. You've been given the privilege and the power to go out and change the world.

So what I really want to impress on you is that because you have been given this power, I think it's important to know what that power can be used for.

&#x200B;

# The importance of ethics in technology

And I know that there's already been talk; I'm sure you've heard all about, you know, oh, there's ethics in AI and, you know, there's, uh, I don't know, you know, all these other, like, tech-related things, and you're like, ""Wait a minute, you know, this Gaza thing, sure, it's an issue, but what does it have to do with me? I'm someone who's going to work in engineering and technology. So what does this have to do with me?"" But it does, right?

So, something I've heard from all the people that I've talked to out here, and you know, I've been trying my best to listen, and I'm not going to sit up here and pretend, like, ""Well, I'm an expert, listen to me, whatever."" I'm just one guy who's trying to do his best to learn about the issues. So one thing I've heard from a lot of people which really resonated with me is that we are not free until Palestine is free. So what does that mean? Well, I think you can interpret it lots of different ways. I'm not going to tell you how to interpret it, but to me, what it means is that all of our struggles are interconnected.

So when you go out and work for something like, let's go develop some AI that's going to recognize people's faces or whatever, well, that kind of technology is something that all these armies are using to identify people and protesters and try to prosecute them. Like, that's connected. Or, you know, if you go out and work for social media companies, right? You're like, ""Wait, that's nothing to do with me. What does it have to do with all this stuff? I thought this is not related to me. I'm the CS major. Get this, like, liberal arts crap away from me.

""But, um, it's connected because if you go out and work for some social media company, like, think about all the disinformation we've been seeing about this conflict. We've been seeing, you know, I mean, heck, even the fact that people are calling it a conflict, and people think, ""Oh, it's a war between two sides that have equal capability."" It's not a war. It's a genocide. There's one side that is absolutely being wiped out and bombed indiscriminately, and I think that's something that's not getting out there. And as someone who designs social media platforms and has the ability to go and change the way in which people receive information, you too have a big place in this struggle. It's not just, ""Oh, I'm a CS major. There's nothing to do with CS."" They're connected, okay.

&#x200B;

# Funding and Priorities

And I mean, even for me, sure, I don't have a tech job or whatever, but I work in education. Even something like the education sector, I feel connected to this too. So, think about it. Has anyone had trouble getting into 61B or any other classes? Has that been something everyone's been experiencing? Once you get to the upper divs, I promise you'll have trouble getting into classes, no question, right? Has everyone been experiencing those 100-minute office hour wait times that we're trying our best to get through? You know those, right? Or even just posting on Ed, waiting two days, no answer because there's just so few of us and so many of you, right? We're all underpaid, overworked. There are too many of you coming in, but why does it have to be that way?

Why is it that, you know, I have to be here, teaching all these different classes, and all of our TAs have to, you know, we tell them not to overwork, but we end up all just doing what we can to help you, and we still can't get to all of you. Why do we have to turn you away when you need help? Well, why aren't we funded? Why is the EECS department so chronically underfunded this way? I'm not saying there's a direct correlation. I'm not going to accuse the EECS department of whatever. But as a state-funded school and as a government-funded, publicly funded university, there are priorities in this country, and somehow the priority in this country is not to fund the education that you are paying a load of tuition for.

Somehow, all this money is getting funneled into sending bombs to other countries so they can bomb children in hospitals. Like, you know, that's something that resonates with me because I think that part of my struggle to get you all the education that I think you deserve is connected to the fact that our governments are okay with underfunding the EECS Department over and over and over again until we have no money left to support any of you. Meanwhile, it seems like every time Israel needs more bombs, they can always pull up the money that they need. How? How can that be right?

&#x200B;

# It doesn't feel right

So, I find those kind of things connected. When I see the people of Palestine band together and live through really what is just some of the most horrific things, like, I've ever seen in my life, I see that stuff. I don't even know if I can watch it sometimes. Like God. And, you know, when I see this stuff, part of me, of course, feels like pity and sympathy. Part of me feels anger—anger that my tax dollars are being used to fund it, anger that your tax dollars and tuitions are being used to fund it. I mean, what kind of tuition are you paying to get this kind of subpar staff support? I'm okay with saying it. Like, we do our best, but it's ultimately not what you deserve. What kind of tuition are you paying? I paid like five figures, you know? I don't know how much are we talking these days. Has tuition gone up recently? I don't even know. Forget the housing and all that. What, 100,000, 200,000? I don't know, man. It's just so much, and you're not getting what you deserve as students.

I think that, you know, even there, the struggle is interconnected. We are connected to these people in ways that even I'm still learning about. Anyway, when I see these things, you know, some part of me feels pity and sympathy, and part of me feels anger again that I'm here and I can do anything about it. My representatives are all out there voting to send them more bombs, and there's nothing I can do about it, except I guess, you know, selfishly come up here and waste all of your time talking about this.

&#x200B;

# Standing in solidarity

Something else that I feel, which I think is so much stronger than any of those other feelings of pity or sympathy or even anger, is at a very deep level, I feel solidarity with these people. The people of Palestine are out here suffering things that I will never, ever have to suffer, God willing, and things that I will never be able to even imagine—the horrors of an entire family being wiped out. There are people whose entire families have been wiped out, and that last name just doesn't exist anymore. I just think about that, and I'm like, how can I even imagine what that's like? There are people out there who have lost their homes, have been forced to go to other places, and then still been bombed. I can't imagine what that's like.

And again, I think it's fair to feel pity and sympathy, and I think that's a valid thing to feel. But I also, on a deep level, feel solidarity. The people of Palestine give me the bravery to stand up here and tell you about this, even if it costs me my job, my reputation, whatever. Like, I think this is important enough to come up here and tell you about it. And, again, I want to remind you that all these struggles, to me, they're interconnected. So when you go out and you have the power to change the world, really—I know it sounds so utopian and like, really, but, you know, software and computer science really is one of these forefront fields.

When you go out, when you have the power to write code that is complex and the ability to manage it, and heck, the ability to take the stuff we've learned, use it in your software engineering interviews, and get all the jobs that you want, that kind of thing gives you power. It gives you privilege. You might have the money to do something about this. You might have the ability to contribute to companies that are either actively supporting or opposing or doing something about injustices like this.

&#x200B;

# Parting thoughts

Hey, maybe like 10 years down the line, there will be something else that comes up, and that's okay. I don't need you to remember any specific struggle or whatever, but I want you to remember that this overall struggle for justice, for equality, it is something that we are all in together. When you go out and when you go out with this power that we've given you, the power to, again, really change the world with the ability to program and construct software that you've been given, I just want to remind you that that power comes with a lot of responsibility. I really hope that when you go out, you remember that even though maybe CS on the surface doesn't seem connected to all of this, it is all connected. I feel solidarity with the Palestinian people. I feel that they give me the bravery to say this as an educator, and I hope they give you the bravery to go out and take a stand for things like this and do what's right.

Again, I know this wasn't super appropriate. If you want to report me and get me in trouble for it, like, fine, whatever. One other thing is, I don't feel like I'm super qualified to talk about all this either. (Asks anyone from the audience to share their thoughts afterward.) That's really all I want to say. So again, it's been a good semester. I'll still be around, of course. So, yeah, thanks for coming to all the lectures. I appreciate it. Of course, it is, you know, free Palestine all day, every day, and I want you to remember that your struggle and the Palestinian people's struggle and all of our struggles are interconnected, and I want you to remember to feel that solidarity. So, that's all I have. Thanks for your time, and I'll see you next time.

There better be protests in support of this professor. I can't believe people came out in droves for the professor who got terminated for stalking her ex, but there hasn't been any talk of defending this professor who delivered an eloquent speech on the reality of the genocide.
What a king
It doesn’t matter what my opinion is this guy should be an example for our entire generation. This is independent thought and free speech to the ideal. He’s using (and perhaps even sacrificing ) his platform to talk about something that’s obviously important to him. That’s the definition of authenticity.

LMAO there are a number of lines in his monologue that are either blatant lies, or the indivudual does not have a good grasp of the entire situation.  This is one passage that really made me chuckle, further proof that Mr. Kao is infected with the ""academia bubble"" that doesn't allow them to grasp the real world.
Thank you. The world appreciates your humanity and courage.  Much love and respect.
""Some expletives that didn't translate well into formal text have been removed.""

so, not  a transcript.
Why is everyone acting like it’s some brave position to be anti-Israel at Berkeley?

The overwhelming majority of students and faculty at Cal have been vehemently pro-Palestine…to the point that many (I know not all) have condoned or dismissed Hamas’ massacre.

Giving a speech in favor of Israel would have been an objectively braver position given the overwhelmingly anti-Zionist sentiments on campus.

Also, having listened to this speech, it’s very clear that this lecturer knows very, very little about the I/P conflict. Did anyone learn anything from this? He’s just speaking in platitudes and issuing vague statements related to “ethnic cleansing” and “genocide.” 

I know many of you don’t want to admit this, but the I/P conflict is extremely nuanced and complicated. Extremist elements on both sides (namely the illegal settlers and their far-right supporters for Israel and Islamist terror groups like Hamas and PIJ in Palestine) are standing in the way of any reconciliation talks.

There’s no easy solution to this. It will take uprooting extremist factions on both sides to take a step forward (that means Netanyahu and his coalition in addition to Hamas…which necessitates a war against Hamas).
thank you for this. liberal arts student here. massive respect to him for this.
What a evil creature.
All throughout his speech, he kept saying “I’m probably gonna get in trouble for this”, or words to that effect. And yet, there are comments here saying that being pro-Palestine is the status quo, and that taking a pro-Israel stance is somehow “braver”??? 

If there truly is an unbiased debate, why is one side unapologetic in their views, while the other side constantly feels the need to be conciliatory?
For me there are two types of disagreements. The first is just a basic disagreement where I have a different opinion, but I can understand why someone would think differently thus it is not like I consider the other opinion ""invalid."" Assuming the other person feels the same way about my views (which is rare nowadays tbh), we can theoretically have a healthy conversation about whatever the topic is. A lot of this falls into that first category.

But then, there are other disagreements where I cannot possibly see how someone could ever think/say something like what they did, and it makes me lose respect for the individual making the claim. This falls into that second category:

> But I also do want to remind you all that the attacks that happened in October are not an excuse to bomb people back. That's not how it works. You don't just say, ""Oh, well, some people got bombed so I'm going to bomb them back."" That's not how that works, okay?

So an organization/country that gets attacked has no right to respond? How does that work? Would Peyrin like to have Hamas continue to bomb Israel with no repercussions? Makes no sense!
i love him.
So a bunch of rehashed social media points from someone who barely knew what Israel and Palestine a month ago.
I’m so proud of him! This is so well said.
""""Oh, well, some people got bombed so I'm going to bomb them back."" That's not how that works, okay?""

That is actually exactly how that works...

Imagine if a country bombed America. We'd reduce their country to ashes.
Ok. There are numerous pieces of misinformation in what he said here. This is absolutely irresponsible to present to your class whether or not you give a disclaimer before about how “lecture is over.”
What a hero! Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Thank you for speaking up, creating a transcript, and sharing it here. From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.

Mr. Kao. You are brave. And, you are right - everything we do have ethical implications. From what we eat to obviously, technology.
Why does everyone feel the need to posture?  This guy is an Asian computer science teacher.  What does he know about the conflict?  Just because you read a bunch of @impact stories on Instagram doesn't mean you have the knowledge and tact necessary to speak out on this stuff.  He even admits this, confirming it is simply an egotistical posture stunt.
People, please understand, this is political indoctrination. He is asserting his own political view points as academic material in a technical course.

> our governments are okay with underfunding the EECS Department over and over and over again until we have no money left to support any of you. Meanwhile, it seems like every time Israel needs more bombs, they can always pull up the money that they need. How? How can that be right?

Yea, this is a political stance. ""underfunding"" according to what ? Tying in the success of an EECS student to taking a stance on Israel or Palestine is indoctrination. He should be disciplined for this.

If you want to learn about Palestine take the Palestine Decal. They present historical evidence and details and present THEIR side of the story. They do not make affirmative claims and political ideas that this guy is doing.
The October 6 attack by Hamas killed 1500 people. Israel has a population of about 10 million.

The equivalent of an attack on the United States with a population of about 320 million would be if about 48,000 people were killed in one day.

The question is, what would you want done if say, a white nationalist group executed an attack like that on the U.S., and said they wanted to do it again, and again, and again. Sure you would want to do something. Would you still do something if somebody then claimed that you were engaging in a genocide on the white supremacists? 

>the attacks that happened in October are not an excuse to bomb people back

This professor believes that nothing should be done.
is hamas a terrorist organization in your eyes?
I’m a member of LGBT. Gay people are legally tortured and executed in Gaza district. Despite this, I can’t help develop sympathy towards people there when I see them on TV and news. 
I condemn the genocide but not sure how to feel about the fact that they will resume killing our people again when the war is over. I wonder how one can feel the dignity and pride supporting the group of people when they wish us death during peaceful time. Normally I would keep the energy same…
[deleted]
Can someone clarify what administrative action he is facing?
Fire his fucking ass now
“If you want to go, you can. But this is my last lecture…” This really implies “you should stay”. And when a professor - person with power over your future - says this, no one is really going to leave. He knew that.
>""Oh, well, some people got bombed so I'm going to bomb them back."" That's not how that works, okay?

Ironically, the peace that Kao himself enjoys comes from bombing the shit out of Japan/Germany.

I have a lot of sympathy for Palestinian civilians, but Israeli government has to do what it needs to do to protect its people from further brutalization. Hamas shares a lot of responsibility for the civilian deaths in Palestine by commingling civilian infrastructure with military.
It's hilarious that this clown has been spending time ""thinking about this issue."". I have friends and family who are in the thick of it.  They really don't care what he thinks or what other random Berkeley CS professors think.
'diversity' in our faculty and staff shouldn't only be limited to indians asians and white males. when zionists get into staff they should be diversified too!
He clearly talked about it without really learning about the extremely complex history of I-P.

Hell, he didn't even learn about the present with how described the initial hamas attack as ""bombing"" and the dispelled myth that Israel bombed the hospital (it was a missile from a Palestinian group that landed in a hospital parking lot).
fr, his speech really resonated with me and I took 61b 3 years ago. This honestly seems more in-scope for 61b than Professor Hug's ""[be ethical with your skills as a SWE](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EAS7Gruz3hbXgxu7CqvsAZ46g76HGCKHgzDdRl2ZE6A/edit#slide=id.g1f266a1b94_0_146)"" lecture. No one called that out of scope for a data structures class even though that went way off from the course content
For the record, Ivonne del Valle wasn’t stalking her ex. Joshua Clover, the person she was stalking, never dated her. Which makes the story even more weird. She just developed an obsession with him.
absolutely, he gave a compassionate and well-researched optional speech and i really hope berkeley comes out in support for him the same way he's come out in support for students!
Do people just throw around the words ""genocide"" these days to mean ""war""?   How are Gazans being ""wiped out"" when their population keeps growing?
If this is eloquent then Berkeley has slipped. I read this and all I can think is how young and naive he sounds. He’s not eloquent or deep or well thought or even well argued. He’s just not
Dude, look up the definition of “genocide”. Regardless of who you sympathize with, calling it a “genocide” is factually wrong and honestly a disgrace for the Yugoslavian, Rwandan, Armenian, Jewish people (non exhaustive list).

Calling it something it is not just pollutes the debate and creates more division.
No
Trump used and uses his position to exercise his free speech about things that are important to him too.  And what does authentic mean other than ""vent/rant""?  Is ""venting / ranting"" to a captured audience in a classroom what a university professor should do, or should they debate someone with the opposite position in an auditorium?  My guess is any student that stood up and countered any of his points would have been shouted down and kicked out...which is exactly what happens at Trump speeches.  Note Trump does not debate...nor does he allow free speech if he doesn't like it.
I don't know if you have noticed, but many academics have actually lost their jobs for showing support for Palestine. Laws have been passed in states that make advocating for BDS illegal (a violation of free speech). The academic bubble is an exact inversion of what you claim it is.

Fair criticism. This is how the output from the automatic transcription service was. That is the reason I warned users about it missing and recommending people watch the video instead. 

I’m not an expert court stenographer by any means. Just wanted to create a more informed discussion on the topic.
The fact that admin sent out a strongly worded email saying he wasn't supposed to talk about it, when plenty of faculty have made less controversial political statements before, is why it's brave. The younger generation is pro-Palestine, faculty is overwhelmingly not.

I'm glad that we agree that both Hamas and Natenyahu's government are extremist factions. Hamas is worse in terms of intent, but Natenyahu's government has a lot more actual power.

Unlike Hamas though, which the US rightfully considers a terrorist organization, we continue to give Israel's government money with almost no strings attached. This has gone on for well before 10/7 attack. At the very least, I'd like to see any and all aid to Israel strictly conditioned on ending the west bank settlements.
giving a speech in favor of israel would also not provide a segue to talking about ethics in CS, as usually professors don’t call on their students to use their talents to prop up a surveillance state

you can argue that the situation before the war was complicated, but israel has used biometric and facial recognition technology, as well as malware like pegasus, to essentially spy on perceived threats and uphold the territorial claims of illegal settlers
100%

This might be the most reasonable and coherent comment on this topic I’ve seen in this extreme
echo chamber sub. Same goes for IRL campus talk.  Zero nuance. Oversimplification and bias to the point of dogma.
Maybe because there have been professors that have been vehemently pro Israel and have received no repercussions?
>like it’s some brave position to be anti-Israel at Berkeley?

Talking about politics in a technical course is political indoctrination. 

Especially the part how CS (or anything) is all connected to the Gaza/Israel conflict. That's political indoctrination.
It’s because college students think they are different and in the absolute right for supporting the little guy. (Ironic because  18 million Jews in this world vs 1.8 billion Islamic people)

Also victimhood, if your side is always the victim. You feel better about yourself. You can think in black and white. You’re basically admitting you’re dumb but you can pat yourself on your back.
At this point, it’s brave anymore. And let’s not act like Berkeley is the same Berkeley from the 60s/70s.
Given that the political apparatus of our country is unilaterally pro-Israel, I would posit that saying nothing means that you side with Israel.

He talks about this in simple terms because, despite how complicated the overarching conflict is, the morality of what is going on right now is simple and clear. Israel is committing a genocide against Gaza. They have more or less said so themselves, with many high ranking military officials and politicians advocating to complete wipe Gaza off the map. Whatever your feelings are on the conflict at large, the mass killing that is currently happening has to stop.

I have friends in academia. Saying that you support Palestine can literally cost you your job. Many people have been fired for it. Some states have passed laws making it illegal to advocate for BDS. What Peyrin did here took serious balls.
I am an alumnus and I support the letter that Prof. Claire Tomlin sent out. If an instructor wants to talk about his/her political beliefs that are entirely unrelated to the class he/she teaches, there is Sproul Plaza. 

61B’s podium is to teach data structure and algorithms, not pro-Palestine/pro-Israel or pro-whatever, no matter how many disclaimers the instructor made before the preaching
The reason he would get in trouble is because a technical course should not be politically charged. It's political indoctrination. 

Even in the palestine decal they give historical details supported by evidence, and the Palestinian side of the story. They do not make affirmative claims .
He makes a few decent points but that line is exactly where he lost me, too.

>That's not how that works, okay?

Actually, that's exactly how war has worked since one tribe of hominids first raided another tribe's cave. Should we have stayed out of WWII even after Pearl Harbor? Should we have tried to resolve things diplomatically with the Nazis and Japan? That sure worked great for Chamberlain, after all. 

I've also never heard a decent argument to support the ethnic cleansing and genocide claims. Gaza's population has exploded over the past few decades and 21% of residents in Israel proper are Palestinian. 

How can someone so intelligent have such uneducated views? It's like his political brain and academic brain are two separate entities.
They have a right... Just not the right to bomb Palestinian civilians. Kinda similar to how bin laden did 911 but the US shouldn't bomb Iraq.
Perhaps the reason that you can't see how this position could ever make sense is because you have oversimplified it based on a very literal interpretation. 

Rights to defensive war making have always been protected by international law, even including proactive measures to prevent certain harms from befalling your court. The point he intends to make is just because Hamas the terrorist organization has broken the international law on the rules of war as given in the Geneva conventions, does not mean Israel can then also break the laws of war. Of course Israel wants to fight back against Hamas which is a destructive and evil group but they are either unable or unwilling to exercise control in their response as their weapons are not able to discriminate effectively enough between military targets and civilian targets, and they are killing far too many non combatants and breaking pretty much all of the different law of war. 

Hamas, a non state entity and terrorist group will of course not follow these laws of war, but that doesn't mean Israel should also ignore them. It might make it much harder for them to combat Hamas, but they need to find a way that doesn't involve wiping out all of the infrastructure in Gaza and leaving it's civilian populations destitute and dead. If they continue they will find no path to any two state solutions or peace and they will continue to radicalize the gazan people. They need to be held to the international legal standards even if their opponents are not because they are the nation state and the holder of the much higher degree of power and ability in the conflict.
[deleted]
I think he’s referring to the fact that Israel is enacting collective punishment on Gazan civilians. He is also pointing to the fact that seeing only Israel’s actions as a “reaction” is extremely deceptive, given that Israel is the occupying state, keeping Palestinians enclosed in an open-air prison, literally controlling their access to basic necessities of food, water, and electricity.
So you are faulting someone for educating themselves on a topic they were previously unaware of? You’d argue that since they had no knowledge a month ago that they shouldn’t seek it now?!?!
How do you know he’s not educated before this lol
This mentality is everything wrong with this world. I mean, for example, Bin Laden was killed in an operation that was perfectly planned and executed while bombing Afghanistan for 20 years only resulted in the Taliban coming back and ruling the country again. Bombing the shit out of everyone only results in more enemies, Isis is basically the result of removing Saddam, and with what is happening the last two months Hamas numbers are basically guaranteed to double if not more.
That's indeed how it works in all countries in the world.

The October 6 attack killed 1,500 Israelis, out of a population of about 10 million.

If a similar attack in England happened, with a population of about 55 million, it would be equivalent to 8,250 being killed in a single day. I cannot imagine that England would do nothing about 8,250 people being killed in one attack. I cannot imagine any country in the world not doing anything.
Yeah and that thought process got us ISIS…
Can you elaborate on what the “pieces of misinformation” were?

I thought he made it quite clear that the lecture was over and students were free to go.
Free Palestine from Hamas.
Want to make it clear that I'm not taking a side on this debate. The goal is instead to create a civil space for informed discussion. From the comments I see many pointing out arguments they find provably false in the statement. While some others agree with the message. Both of which I value. Thanks.
say what you want but carpet bombing Gaza is not the solution
That’s absolutely what happened lol. Are you slow?
So Israel bombing Gazan civilians is justified then? Just because Hamas bombed Israeli civilians?
You’re such a piece of shit it’s not even funny. Makes me physically sick to my stomach.
What does him being Asian have to do with anything? Stop being racist here
do you realize that essentially every class is political “indoctrination” as you put it? just on the very fact that instructors can choose what information to leave out of their lectures and what to put in.. it all connects to power aka politics of what perspective to share with students. even if it’s purely technical information, the instructors are choosing what not to say (for one example, the ethics of the use of a technology, which is talked about by some professors but not by others in a CS class)
[deleted]
I think political indoctrination is a bit of a stretch. For sure, he does not have facts but it is factual that the US sucks in delegating funds towards education compared to other means, say the military.
He says: “I’m not saying there is a direct correlation”.
So if New York City were an independent country, would it be 35 times more justified in launching the War on Terror in response to 9/11 than the United States was, since New York City had 1/35 the population of the United States?
And just as the US unjustly killed way more people in the middle east ""in response"", so is Israel unjustly killing vastly more ""in response"".
What makes you call it genocide?
Not sure if they’ve ever had a peaceful time 😅

also, if i was a student i'd assume he'd be saying something that might be relevant to the class/exams???
I always assume that my professors have my best interests at heart. So when they say “if you want to leave, you can”, I take them at face value, and assume I am not being emotionally gaslit into staying. I’m sorry you’ve had such bad experiences with emotionally manipulative professors to develop the opposite view as me
Ah, the typical zionist ad hominem. You can't argue against them, so you call them ""young and naive""
Yeah agreed. I don't think he deserves to be criticised/fired but this is far from eloquent lol. 

Does not acknowledge the existence of Egypt or their role in making Gaza an ""open-air prison""

Does not acknowledge why the blockade was implemented in the first place or what would happen if it was lifted, because let's face it, he hasn't thought far beyond Israel bad
We don’t want Zion1st terror1st at Berkeley. Fuck off!
Removing cursewords removes emotion and intent. It is removing information from the reader. 

Censoring a speech is a mistake.
I think you can censor it to f\**k and s*\*t. This way people feel less offended by it but can also know the exact speech
Sincere question: who is threatening to fire him?
No strings attached? Really?

How much aid do you think has been given to Palestinians? Jordan? Egypt?
Look at the Hamas charter, I’d say you’ve got it backwards. Hamas is maybe as bad in terms of civilian deaths in practice (major asterisk here given 60% of October 7 deaths were IDF, compared to a 99% civilian casualty rate on the Israeli side) but the only ones actively calling for genocide are the israelis
We’ve given billions to Hamas. Where do you think their leaders got their wealth from?
It's incredibly stupid is what it is.
AH, okay. So, Hamas attacked Israel, brutally raped, beheaded, and murdered hundreds of Israelis, and expects Israel to stay quiet and watch the show letting the rest of their tiny country die? 

\*Hamas's charter quite literally states that they want to kill all Jews and destroy the state of Israel (how peaceful!)\*

Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East, the only country in the Middle East that supports LGBTQ+ individuals and allows people of all religions (Christians, Muslims, Armenians, and Jews) to vote, run for governmental positions and work as doctors + lawyers. Israel provides their neighbors (who constantly attack them) with healthcare and medical support, despite their neighbors just wanting to destroy their country. It's absolutely heartbreaking and awful how the narrative LIES to people and makes Israel seem like the enemy when it's Hamas, the terrorist organization that uses Palestinian people as human shields.

Famine in Yemen has been ongoing for 7 years due to an active blockage by the Saudi government, affecting 24 million people and killing more than 130k (mostly children). And this is met with 7 years of indifference.  
Israel decides not to provide assistance for 7 days to the region that just attacked it... and you suddenly hear ""genocide"" and ""colonialism"" from college campuses.

Do you even know what genocide means? Are you at all aware of what an ethnic cleansing actually indicates?  
The Arab population in Israel was 156,000 in 1948, and in 2023, it's 2,100,000. That is an insane increase in population. The Arab population in Gaza was 80,000 in 1948 and is 2,000,000 in 2023. How exactly is that ethnic cleansing? How exactly has the Gazan nation declined in numbers?
What repercussions has this lecturer received for giving this speech?
Explaining how CS is connected to the conflict isn’t indoctrination lmfao? It’s a fact
Ah yes, the little guy that gets 10.4 million dollars from the us every day from 2016 until 2028. Totaling 38 billion. Source: https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/14/fact-sheet-memorandum-understanding-reached-israel
1.8bil people aren't in palestine, the issue is clearly about palestinian not global islamic people. Weak argument.   
And both sides play the victim card, as with any war.
I think by ""them"" he's not referring to enemy combatants but to civilians. He's saying ""Just because Hamas bombed Israeli civilians doesn't give Israel the right to bomb Gazan civilians.""
>Should we have stayed out of WWII even after Pearl Harbor?

Excellent point. The population of the U.S. in 1942 was about 135 million, while the attack killed about 2400.

With a population in Israel of about 10 million, that would be the equivalent of about 178 killed. The October 6 attack by Hamas killed 1500, or an equivalent of 20,250 of the U.S. 1942 population.

No one attack in the U.S. has come even close. Not Pearl Harbor, not 9-11, nothing even remotely compares.
Peyrin seemingly had no objective to this soliloquy.  From what I gather, he has only a very recent and incomplete understanding of the extremely complex history of the conflict and its intersectionality with religion, race, and geopolitics.  If anything, his emotional rant is really immature and something I view as an egotistic virtue signal.  It's simply not his place to comment on something this charged and complicated, especially as someone who is not tied to the region in any way.
[deleted]
Instead they should just send over some tea and crumpets along with a care package to Hamas leadership. What a fucking braindead take.
I appreciate the effort you took to craft this argument. But frankly I don't see how you can get any of that directly from what Peyrin said, you have to make several logical leaps/assumptions to get to that interpretation.

> the attacks that happened in October are not an excuse to bomb people back

//

Plus, to respond to what you said:

> they are either unable or unwilling to exercise control in their response as their weapons are not able to discriminate effectively enough between military targets and civilian targets

Perhaps this is due to Hamas's ability to make it as difficult as possible to discriminate effectively between military and civilians. Which in many cases is also a violation of international law. So sure, I'm not going to debate that Israel is targeting hospitals or bombing civilians. That's because Hamas is operating there as well, and Hamas should be the group (primarily) held responsible for loss of civilian life in Gaza.
>Of course Israel wants to fight back against Hamas which is a destructive and evil group but they are either unable or unwilling to exercise control in their response as their weapons are not able to discriminate effectively enough between military targets and civilian targets, and they are killing far too many non combatants and breaking pretty much all of the different law of war.

There realistically is no alternative.   We don't have assassination drones or whatever you would need to cleanly separate military from civilian. The Palestinian civilians are unable or unwilling to help Israel take out Hamas operatives either.

It's not even clear if they are breaking many laws of wars. Hamas has used hospitals for military purposes; legally speaking, Israel is allowed to blow the hospital up (though they haven't).

>If they continue they will find no path to any two state solutions or peace and they will continue to radicalize the gazan people.

Nah, radicalization is caused by the middle ground Israeli is in where they have historically caused comparatively little damage which feeds into propaganda.  Given free reign to destroy Hamas would actually stop this problem because people would understand join Hamas = quick death.  (Note how Sri Lanka ended Tamil terrorism by simply destroying the LTTE).  Right now, that's not the equation, so folks rationally join Hamas for whatever reason.

There's no path to a two state solution regardless.  In fact, Hamas existing makes it worse (note how Hamas increased suicide bombings after Oslo and ultimately led to a fearful Israeli publish shifting right).
>Frankly, yeah, I don't believe it's a state's right to indiscriminately bomb population centers even if it's a retaliation for something.

What's the alternative?

>Hamas' actions do not come in a vacuum, and so many people are constantly defending Israel's right to attack Palestine but would never consider Palestinians' right to defend themselves against an ongoing genocide.

Palestine has a right so to speak to fight the IDF. They don't have a right to mass murder civilians.

>If a slave revolt happened in history and the slaves slaughtered people in the process of trying to secure their freedom, would you have supported the government of that state putting down said slave revolt, especially if that meant bombing far more innocent civilians than anyone else?

This is a pretty complex question.  If we know the slaves would genocide the enslaving ethnicity (e.g. Haiti), this isn't black and white.
He can educate himself, but preferably not via low-quality ""rehashed social media points,"" and he certainly shouldn't regurgitate those same points to a classroom audience.
He said:

* ""The thing about Gaza, which I don't know how many, you know, I had to learn as well and get informed too""
* ""I'm not going to sit up here and pretend, like, ""Well, I'm an expert, listen to me, whatever."" I'm just one guy who's trying to do his best to learn about the issues.""
* ""One other thing is, I don't feel like I'm super qualified to talk about all this either.""
We can tell
It's absolutely fucking sick that the indiscriminate obliteration of thousands of families is being excused under the banner of ""they started it."" It was exactly the same mindset that justified Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq, and shows that nobody has learned from it. (And this is *without* even getting into the historical context of how and why Hamas came to exist in the first place). Plus, as you say, the intelligence and military tech available to conduct very specific and very targeted campaigns against Hamas is all there. This is a nation who's intelligence services and military rescued their own people from fucking Idi Amin's Uganda, and backed by the most powerful nation on earth who has undertaken some of the most strategically planned covert ops in all of human history. But nah, we're expected to believe that the *only* way to get Hamas is by indiscriminate bombings of fucking hospitals, bakeries, schools, and refugee camps with a civilian to Hamas death ratio approaching 200:1. We're expected to justify this all under the banner of self-defence and ""they started it."" 

You're exactly right that this callous regard for human life is sickening. Everyone knows and says Hamas are awful, but it's quite obvious that *not* everyone is applying the same logic to Israel because they think that self-defense justifies all of it. Ultimately, you (and by 'you' I am meaning people like the person you replied to) need to have a long hard think about your own morals if you at all are finding ways to justify what is happening in Gaza.
Sri Lanka is peaceful now after bombing the shit out of the LTTE.

This method absolutely can work. What doesn't work is calling ""cease fires"" and leaving the terrorist group around.

US had the same problem as Israel -- fights with one hand tied behind it's back.  So it's better to not even try. (Except Israel actually has to try given how frequently it gets attacked..0
That is indeed NOT how it works, and despite your obvious confusion throughout this thread, counter insurgency is actually well understood. Especially so following 20 years of refining with various degrees of success and failure in theaters around the world. 

If you are interested in understanding this topic better, this is a great starting place: https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1311&context=ils

When you read it, you’ll find that we understood in 2003 that the actions Israel is taking now are not only criminal, but also counter productive to their goals.
“I don’t like what he said so I’m going to say he said a bunch of misinformation but not actually give specific examples or elaborate.” - The guy you responded to
He misconstrues the 10/7 attack as Hamas ""bombing"" Israelis. That's not the extent of what happened and framing it as such is in bad faith. He could've made just as much of his point while still giving full presence to what happened: mass rape, mutilation, brutalization of corpses (Shani Louk's limbs at inhuman angles. There are videos of her body being driven around Gaza). I don't get why he glosses over 10/7 as ""bombing"".
Free your brain cells
They aren't ""carpet combing"" Gaza - it's rather targeted bombing.

That said, what is the solution?
It's fair to debate exactly what the correct level of force to use back is. Completely. I respect your view that perhaps Israel used too much. Given that Hamas has persisted all these years, it is an interesting question to ask.

However, I would have to disagree vehemently with the argument that Israel can do nothing.
Thanks for telling everyone you don't know what carpet bombing is. Well done.
Do you know what carpet bombing is? It doesn't involve less than one casualty per bomb.
Say what you want, but maybe it's part of the solution.
Do you think that hiding your military installations among civilian infrastructure, such as Hospitals, means they are immune to repercussions?

If so, then it becomes the best possible strategy for groups like Hamas to continue to operate among civilians, as human shields.
They are generally bombing Hamas military targets. Unfortunately, civilians happen to be there.
""Just because Hamas bombed Israeli civilians"" Is bombing a codeword for indiscriminate mass shooting, torture, kidnapping?
Yes, that's correct.
Blue haired redditor gets upset at reasonable opinion
Because he doesn't have any ethnic or religious ties to the conflict.  At best, he's been studying this topic for years (unlikely).  At worst, he's been reading news headlines and doesn't have anywhere near the context and historical knowledge to make informed statements (likely, evidenced not only by the content of his speech but by his admittance of the fact he wasn't fully informed).  Didn't think this needed explanation, but here we are.  I also encourage you to understand what racism means.  It's not in my comment at all.
>just on the very fact that instructors can choose what information to leave out of their lectures and what to put in..

How is that related to politics or policy ? That's not forcing a political opinion and tying that to the outcome of an academic department.

>it all connects to power aka politics of what perspective to share with students. even if it’s purely technical information, the instructors are choosing what not to say (for one example, the ethics of the use of a technology

He claimed the reason the EECS department is underfunded (again an opinion here) is because Israel is funded. That's a 100% political opinion there. Please use some critical thinking skills here.
> If I was watching a genocide play out before me and I refused to speak out, I would be a moral coward. I would feel a deep sense of duty to do anything I can to bring attention to the calamity unfolding before my eyes.

So you can still do that. You can report on what you see as happening in Gaza. But the problematic part is if you tie the support of Gaza to more funding of the EECS department. That's preaching that a political stance / activism would somehow directly influence the life of EECS students. That's the part I believe would be considered indoctrination.

I also think in general if one feels something is inherently wrong, other people should support it if they agree it is wrong, not because they will get a better EECS department.
>US sucks in delegating funds towards education compared to other means, say the military.

Yea but that's not what he said. Education encompasses the entire body of US educational institutions. Military is ALL of the USA military. The UC Berkeley budget is like 5% federal aid and mostly grants afaik ? but this is what he said:

>Somehow, all this money is getting funneled into sending bombs to other countries so they can bomb children in hospitals. Like, you know, that's something that resonates with me because I think that part of my struggle to get you all the education that I think you deserve is connected to the fact that our governments are okay with underfunding the EECS Department over

That's a very direct statement tying that if a student supports Palestine, their EECS department will get more funding. Political indoctrination .

&#x200B;

EDIT: People should support Gaza because they feel its the right moral position. They should NOT do it with the expectation their EECS department will get more funding.
It doesn't matter, he is presenting his political opinions in the context of an academic course.

Do you not get that not even the Palestine decal, taught mostly by Palestinian Americans, projects political opinions into the material, its a history course.
The stupidest part of this argument and comparison to 9/11 is that the number of women and children killed by Israel in ONE month exceeds the number killed by coalition forces in YEARS of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan, combined. The rate at which the IDF kills civilians is unprecedented in the 21st century. I cannot believe the U.S. appeases this and continues to arm war criminals. So many statements by the IDF directly contradict the published U.S. defense policy on the global war on terror, and their mass collateral damage strategy is established as counter productive.
> One of the most dangerous countries in the world for LGBTQ is right here in the US

Not sure if trolling?
Is there any data you’re referencing to say US is one of the most dangerous? Because I’d be very surprised if that were the case.
2 sides are not morally equivalent - Hamas is fighting an information war and winning.
During their mission to remove a terrorist government oppressing the palestinian people in Gaza.
Lmfao actually ridiculous. Targeted by the professor or other students? Do you even go here? Most people don’t even go to lectures in the first place
“it's all optional fun stuff”
💯
So just to be clear, your issue isn’t with his speech, but his omission of the magic words “this will not be on the exam”?
So instead you would stay and get gaslit with his  opinions on a subject not in his wheelhouse and which he admits he only started learning about recently. And because of your assumption about professors, you’re more likely to believe his untruths. You just exemplified one of the big problems in doing what he did.
I think the issue is that even if a professor is not ""emotionally manipulative"", they are in a position of authority and responsibility over students, who are coming to class to listen to them as the voice of knowledge; the size of 61B also plays a role. I think that some students could take the statement at face value but many others might still feel some internal obligation to stay, even if they might prefer to not listen. I think the uni would be in the right to at the very least make the instructor aware of that. 

For the record I think this a pretty pervasive issue across many places, not just this particular academic instance.
he seems to be under the impression that Hamas just ""bombed"" Israel on 10/7
I don't want Hamas terrorists like you at Berkeley.
Zionists are the terrorists?!? Oh the irony…

Fair enough, revised my claim. A strongly worded email from admin is not a direct threat to fire.
> (major asterisk here given 60% of October 7 deaths were IDF, compared to a 99% civilian casualty rate on the Israeli side) but the only ones actively calling for genocide are the israelis

You made a number of fairly extreme claims here - can you provide sources?
This is copypasta right?
I'm sure many Germany midcentury professors would have a lot to say about ""the dangers of semitism"" and they would see it as very relevant to the work they did.
Which pales in comparison to [foreign aid given to MENA countries](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/countries-that-receive-the-most-foreign-aid-from-the-u-s). So I’m not sure why you or Kao would only take issue with Israel when the U.S. gives billions more in aid to governments that want to genocide Israel, unless perhaps you’re harboring antisemitic biases
ok, don't give Israel aid.  Do you think the end result would be any different?  

(I'd argue Israel would be even more aggressive, since there'd be no US check on what they do).

I never said Jews were the little guys in this situation. They aren’t in this situation but the whole Israel State is much more nuanced than that. 

I just pointed something that’s a bit ironic.
I know what he's saying and he's still wrong. When military targets are in areas with many civilians, collateral damage is a terrible and inevitable part of war. Hundreds of thousands of Japanese, German, and Italian civilians died by American hands in WWII while we were defeating their governments. Were we committing mass genocide against them? 

My point is that the existence of civilian casualties is not enough to support the claim of genocide. I've seen no evidence that Israel is systematically bombing large groups of civilians for no reason other than killing innocents. The few accounts I have heard, like the hospital bombing that ""killed 500 people,"" turned out to be completely false.
People complaining about ""hurting civilians"" is EXACTLY why Hamas chooses to put their operations in Civilian locations; it's called using your own people as a human shield.

Surveys have shown over a 70% support rate for Hamas in Gaza.
Even if that is what he meant that's 100% horse shit.
No, but we shouldn't have bombed Japanese civilians.
Maybe he’s just trying to use his voice in solidarity and awareness, it’s not egotistical. The reason you don’t see what Peyrin did happening everywhere right now is because people are rolling over in lieu of human rights violations and not using their voice cause their actions would be against the rules or hurt personal image. Re… Check.

>Genocide Scholars and 100 Palestinian and International Civil Society Organisations Call on Prosecutor Khan to Issue Arrest Warrants, Investigate Israeli Crimes and Intervene to Deter Incitement to Commit Genocide in Gaza

I'm sure you could have found people calling the Allied invasion of Japan and Germany in WW2 ""genocide"" where far more civilians died than Palestinians through the entire history of this conflict. 

Doesn't mean it is true objectively.
No. Instead they should deliver a targeted attack to eliminate Hamas leadership like the US did to Osama bin laden in the Obama presidency.

For the sake of civil discussion. You think after all this bombing people in Gaza would be more inclined to be siding with Hamas, or the next extreme idea, or do you think Israel is actually gonna get a happy neighbor.

Btw, this is my last reply to you so don't try to hard replying.
You are right, this lecture wasn't too well executed or detailed and maybe I'm reading the popular opinion into the words. I assumed bombing the people back meant civilian 'people' as opposed to attacks on military targets. 

As for Hamas making it as hard as possible, you are also right. I think ultimately it's an incredibly difficult situation to resolve. With that said I also think that netanyahu is not much more than a common criminal who would end up in jail if he fell from power, he has been indicted for bribery, fraud, etc. and on top of that he has been implementing policies to expand Israel settlements in the West bank for decades now.  I think if Israel didn't have a radical right wing pm like him they would handle the situation much differently and more methodically. I think for netanyahu if the resolution is a total destruction of all of Gaza and it's people along with Hamas then he will consider it successful.
It's clear from the context that when he refers to ""people"" he's talking about civilians, not Hamas.
Guessing he just wanted to lose his job
Any actual evidence for the ‘mass rape and mutilation’? Even us news outlets like LA times has apologized for reporting Hamas decapitating 40 Israeli babies because that was a lie. Also many of the 1500 civilians that died on oct 7 were killed by IDF soldiers not Hamas, also covered by major news outlets. Do your research
You want to keep hamas in charge of Gaza? The fuck is wrong with you.
You’re right about targeting … targeting entire city blocks and family bloodlines
I didn’t mean it literally. I could just as well have said ‘leveling Gaza’ and it wouldn’t be much of a stretch either
Clearly it’s worked so well over the past few decades and has obviously gotten the conflict closer to being resolved, and led to anything other than civilian deaths
So now the “light unto the nations” stoops to the level of terrorists. 

And it's all ok because Hamas did it first, something something democracy that nearly half of the population can't vote in, something something LGBTQ+ rights even though gays have to leave the country to marry a partner of the same sex, something something secularism even though there are religious courts that are an official part of the state.

Just because he has no ethnic or religious ties doesn’t mean he can’t educate himself and have an opinion. People can learn and there are many sources out there. You don’t need to study middle eastern history for decades to be qualified for an opinion lol
Nuance is necessary. There’s no reason to mention him being “an Asian computer science teacher” in all of this. I also encourage you to understand what I am saying. There is implied racism in what you’re saying.
I don’t think you understood what I said. Everything professors say in lecture is political because they are either choosing to put their opinions or purposefully choosing NOT to put their opinions.. the choice to not give input on a power dynamic (aka politics = power dynamics such as EECS funding, etc.) is also a political choice because these professors have the power to disseminate information. For example, even being apolitical is still a political position, it’s just the position of being indirectly pro status quo
My point was more that this trope of singling out Gaza as an unsafe place for the community is a distraction that works towards the dehumanizing of Palestinians and numbness to the assault against innocent civilians, who are neither terrorists nor LGBTQ-attackers.
It’s dangerous, without comparing to what’s faced in the rest of the world, for sure. https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/for-the-first-time-ever-human-rights-campaign-officially-declares-state-of-emergency-for-lgbtq-americans-issues-national-warning-and-guidebook-to-ensure-safety-for-lgbtq-residents-and-travelers

Source for IDF deaths (basically, it’s Israel’s own tweet) https://x.com/WitnessNewsUK/status/1722589088035779038?s=20

As for the Hamas casualties thing, I think I misremembered a tweet referencing the Hamas commander death toll (50-60) as the overall Hamas toll. Regardless, from Israel’s own numbers at most 10% of their murders have been military targets https://www.newsweek.com/israel-hamas-gaza-idf-dead-1838799
The aid they give to *one* country pales in comparison to the aid they give to *an entire region of the world combined.*

🤦🏻‍♂️
100% agree. Feel free to stop giving US aid to the entire Middle East.


But if your goal is is to reduce people killing the fuck out of each other, that's not going to help.
you mention “collateral damage is terrible and inevitable”. what about direct damage? directly and purposefully killing innocent people? like the 2 nukes dropped on japan that killed over 100,000 innocent people in WWII. i agree that it isn’t genocide, but you must concede that this action was intentional and directed at innocents
Well the only reasonable thing to do then is kill 70% of Gazans. They probably signed up to be human shields! Literally no country ever has dealt with terrorists embedding themselves amongst the civilian populace before, this is totally unprecedented. There’s not even a word for it I bet. Israel is so great and so advanced they really are doing a great job, I bet if you compared how many civilians they killed to similar situations (never happened before!) they would definitely not be a major outlier.
How precisely does bombing Gazan civilians serve Israel's goal of being “a light unto the nations,"" as David Ben-Gurion put it? Stooping to the level of terrorists?

https://www.timesofisrael.com/peace-over-territory-says-israels-first-pm-in-long-lost-footage/
Should is a very strong word.

If we allow it, then Japan clearly should have surrendered after Nazi Germany fell. Many in the Japanese military advocated fighting until the total destruction of Japan, a sort of poetic send off into history, and having women and children fight with sharpened sticks if needed.

I'd suggest *The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire, 1936-1945*  by John Toland.
Brain rot argument. Geneva conventions happened in the aftermath of WW2 to make sure things like the fire bombing of Dresden never happened again. Comparing the numbers of civilians who died in WW2 and in the Israel-Palestine conflicts is such a wild statement I’m developing an aneurysm in real time that is going to rupture.

The point is not Hamas the point is Israel is committing a genocide on Gaza civilians. Get your priorities straight.
Unfortunately, terrorists tend to always be around their families.  If they were kind enough to go out to the half of Gaza that isn't so urbanized and fight Israel from there, we wouldn't have all these civilian casualties.

Regardless, you didn't answer the question - what's the alternative for Israel?
I'm not answering your strawman bullshit in a second post.

Maybe you should go to your campus Hillel and ask them in person. WashU has an extremely large Jewish population. If you hate them so much, I think it would be a good thing to start having an open dialogue to get to know these people.

No, NOT choosing to do something is not equivalent to HAVING an opinion.

According to what proof or argument? Please elaborate here.
What war crimes? When combatants place their fucking headquarters in a hospital, who's the one committing war crimes? Maybe you should read up on your Geneva convention articles.

None of those links verify any of your claims.
It's well known that Nagasaki was one of Japan's largest shipbuilding and repair centers and Hiroshima was an industrial center that housed a major military headquarters. The bombings weren't purely intended to kill civilians and were much different in spirit than storming a concert and shooting as many civilians as possible. 

Even if you were right, my point still stands. Civilian casualties are not sufficient to conclude genocide.
Are you an expert in military tactics related to counter insurgency and urban warfare?
I'm confused, you think the firebombing of Dresden was a *genocide* of Germans?

Words have meaning; let's define them.
Israel is freeing the civilians in Gaza from Hamas. This is extremely important. Unless of course you support Hamas.
This argument baffles me, it’s as if people forgot about the last 20 years of conflict in the Middle East. For all the shit the U.S. got for its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, they had an enormously lower rate of collateral damage than the Israelis in the last month. What’s the alternative for Israel? Wage a counter insurgency war by the same rules western counties have been for decades. How is it possible the Israelis have killed more Palestinians in 3 weeks than civilians who died in Afghanistan in 3 years? (2001-2004) How is it possible the Israelis are directly responsible for the death of more women and children in a month than coalition forces were responsible for from 2001-2011? 
You will have a hard time convincing me that, with the numbers I can see with my own eyes, the Israelis are making any effort to reduce civilian casualties. In fact, the IDF are notorious for hamfisted and barbaric counter insurgency, so much so that the American Joint Chiefs of Staff specifically named the IDF’s operations against the PLO as what NOT to do in their official policy on the War on Terror in 2001
There might be a pedophile hiding in your basement. If you agree that pedophiles should be targeted, you basically just agreed that it's fine to target your home.
Saying that condemning war crimes committed by the Israeli government is being anti-Semitic is like saying that condemning the Vatican's cover up of sex abuse is being anti-Catholic. Or criticizing China's genocide of Uyghurs is sinophobic.
Being apolitical might seem like a neutral stance, but in reality, it inadvertently supports the status quo. By abstaining from political engagement, individuals fail to challenge existing power structures and policies. This absence of opposition allows the prevailing power system to persist unchecked, reinforcing the status quo. In essence, choosing to be apolitical indirectly aligns with maintaining the current political order rather than actively advocating for change or improvement, or even pointing out / spreading awareness of its flaws at all. This is because being apolitical and being pro-status quo have similar effects in practice, since not doing anything about the current power structures lets them stay in power, which is what the pro-status pro position wants
Here’s another source for the second claim: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_2023_Israel–Hamas_war

“ the death toll of women, children, and elderly lies at 10,000”

Assuming literally every adult man in Palestine is a Hamas fighter, that still puts the civilian casualty rate at 77%
The first link verifies my first claim, the second link (or you can easily google this yourself) cites Israel’s claims of 1500 Hamas dead, which you yourself are free to compare with the 15000 total dead in Gaza.
They bombed the center of Hiroshima because the industrial areas were “small, fringe, and spread on the periphery of the city”. This led to 75% of the industry being spared while civilian casualties were maximized. No target that they didn’t seek to bomb would have killed more civilians.
I am a veteran who has studied terrorism and counter-terrorism at military colleges in the U.S. Although, it is not what I have my degree in now. It is my belief that the IDF are currently committing war crimes, and their counter-insurgency strategy is barbaric and counter-productive to their goals. The IDF kills civilians at a rate that is unprecedented in the 21st century, especially for states with advanced/modern militaries. Your questions and/or counter points are?
Rhetoric and Latinx studies major actually
I encourage you to read my message in its entirety, and my sources. You will be tempted to disregard them because they do not align with your existing stance. Push aside that temptation and entertain the possibility that we are witnessing genocide.

Requisites for genocide (from https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/genocide.shtml):  
A mental element: the ""intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such""; and  
A physical element, which includes the following five acts, enumerated exhaustively:  
Killing members of the group  
Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group  
Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part  
Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group  
Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group  


Is the state of Israel committing a genocide? I defer to experts on the matter:  
\- Former UN director for the high commissioner for human rights calls it genocide. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/31/un-official-resigns-israel-hamas-war-palestine-new-york](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/31/un-official-resigns-israel-hamas-war-palestine-new-york)  
\- Israeli professor of Holocaust and genocide studies explains EXACTLY why the current conflict meets the legal definition of genocide. [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0)  


Was the firebombing of Dresden genocide? Eh I don't think so, I think it would be hard to prove the intent part. Was it a war crime by post-Geneva standards? Absolutely.
They are not because IDF is slaughtering the civilians in Gaza. They’ve killed over 20,000 people and half of them are children. Tell me how they are ‘freeing’ Gazans if they’ve killed everyone? Going around calling people pro-Hamas sounds like you ran out of actual arguments. If you are Islamophobic and don’t think Palestinian lives matter then what can I say 🥱🥱
>For all the shit the U.S. got for its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, they had an enormously lower rate of collateral damage than the Israelis in the last month.

100k to 500k civilians died in Iraq and 46k civilians died in Afghanistan, so not sure what you are talking about.

>How is it possible the Israelis have killed more Palestinians in 3 weeks than civilians who died in Afghanistan in 3 years?

Hamas is not kind enough to leave civilian heavy areas and fight. Note that there were 11k to 45k Iraqis killed in the initial invasion.

>You will have a hard time convincing me that, with the numbers I can see with my own eyes, the Israelis are making any effort to reduce civilian casualties.

Bombing 40k+ buildings and killing under 10k civilians is remarkably low.  You realize they are telling [civilians](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67327079) to evacuate first, right?
Except I'm willing to co-operate with the authorities in arresting the pedophile.

If Gazans were willing to co-operate with the Israelis in arresting Hamas terrorists, you wouldn't have all this bombing.
Seriously. Walk out of the south 40 and down Forsyth. It's  across from the art museum. 

You're a kid, you're allowed to ask dumb fucking questions without being judged for it now. Eventually it will be too late.
That claim cites a [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-renews-call-gazans-flee-key-southern-city-2023-11-17/) that does not substantiate the numbers; it also cites the Gaza Ministry of Health.
The first link is a tweeted statement (devoid of evidence) that doesn't substantiate your claims. 

I've read the article several times and I don't see anything backing any of your claims. Can you quote the section(s) you're referring to? The article is almost a month old and never mentions what percentage of casualties are civilian.  
At this time, the only casualty numbers I can find online are from the Gaza Ministry of Health and are dubious at best.
[removed]
Did I ask you? No.
While a good guess, I don't think he's the typical blue haired redditor. 

Instead I'm thinking it's more likely the guy is Pakistani and has simply been raised by his family/culture/religious institutions to hate Jews and Israel.
>A mental element: the ""intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such""

If Hamas surrendered, would the bombings continue?  My answer is a strong no.  Unless you feel the answer is ""yes"", the intent is to destroy a political organization (Hamas), not Gazans/Palestinians/etc.

This is the same reason Dresden isn't a *genocide.*  (I'm not debating whether this is a war crime or not -- I'm just annoyed at this ""g"" word being thrown around so loosely)

Your experts are clearly controversial. Not watching a 40 min video, but the clip seems to repeat his argument that is presented [here](https://time.com/6334409/is-whats-happening-gaza-genocide-experts/) which seemingly would label Dresden and the Tokyo firebombings as genocide.  His arguments citing Herzog's statements are also weak; the Allies absolutely blamed the German and Japanese people for allowing their brutal governments to reign, but had no intent to *destroy* them.

I agree with Kierman:

>Ben Kiernan, the director of the Cambodian Genocide Program at Yale University, also agrees. In an emailed statement to TIME, he wrote that “Israel's retaliatory bombing of Gaza, however indiscriminate, and its current ground attacks, despite the numerous civilian casualties they are causing among Gaza's Palestinian population, do not meet the very high threshold that is required to meet the legal definition of genocide.”
Killed everyone? Your hyperbolic nonsense isn't convincing anyone. 

People under the age of 18 can also carry rocket launchers and be part of Hamas. 

If you support Hamas running Gaza that's fine. Just say it.
So u think children who commited murder in the US should be charged the same as adults then? Since israel is condemning children to death for being Hamas
\> Hamas is not kind enough to leave civilian heavy areas and fight.

Oh thank goodness that the Taliban and Iraqi insurgents would leave civilian heavy areas and fight! Oh wait...

I'll make it very clear what I am talking about.

**Afghanistan**

Prof. Marc Herold estimates 3100-3600 civilian casualties where coalition forces were directly responsible. In 20 months from 2001 to 2003. I will cite his estimates rather than that of the Human Rights Watch ([https://www.hrw.org/reports/2008/afghanistan0908/3.htm#\_Toc208224420](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2008/afghanistan0908/3.htm#_Toc208224420))  because his estimates are consistently higher.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071106060601/http://pubpages.unh.edu/\~mwherold/dossier.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20071106060601/http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mwherold/dossier.htm)No data from 2004.

408-478 in 2005. [https://frontline.thehindu.com/cover-story/matrix-of-death/article30197947.ece](https://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/2008/10/06/the-imprecision-ofus-bombing-and-the-under-valuation-of-an-afghan-life.html)

653-769 in 2006.

1010-1297 in 2007.

Moving on because you get the point, you can see nice tabulated format for your convenient perusal here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian\_casualties\_in\_the\_war\_in\_Afghanistan\_(2001%E2%80%932021)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties_in_the_war_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%932021))

**Iraq**

I will be citing the respected Iraq Body Count project [https://www.iraqbodycount.org/database/](https://www.iraqbodycount.org/database/)

I encourage you to go there, enter a query for maximum recorded killed per month from Jan 2003 to Dec 2004 (24 months) and find that it would sum all casualties at the hands of US-led coalition forces to be 10,377. It took ONE MONTH for the Israelis to kill that many Palestinians.

Do I need to spell out for you that U.S.-led coalitian forces fought a war against an army of 375,000 troops? In heavily populated, dense urban areas? Do you recall that the First Battle of Fallujah was in 2004? Remember, that was included in the IBC query we just did together a moment ago.

\>Bombing 40k+ buildings and killing under 10k civilians is remarkably low. You realize they are telling civilians to evacuate first, right?

No, its an astonishingly high casualty rate that is inexcusable in modern conflict. And the perpetrators are war criminals by legal definition.
Yeahhhhh no. As a fellow Jewish person (assuming you're Jewish and not just speaking for all of us without even being a member of the community), what you're implying is utter horseshit. Hope that clarified things.
Gaza ministry of health was cited by every UN org for decades before the current conflict. Fuck out of here with this netenyahu bullshit
The nips?
Damn, you got exactly who you asked for and crumbled LMAO
Ah yes, you can never have a legitimate grievance with Israel, only familial/religious indoctrination.

Give me a break. 🤦🏻‍♂️
If you are so annoyed by the ""g"" word being thrown around so loosely, I am having a hard time understanding why you can't be bothered to watch a 40 min video that explains exactly why it is a genocide. Few things in modern history are as important as a genocide unfolding in front of our eyes, so would it not be prudent to make a reasonable effort to discern whether it is true?

My experts are clearly controversial..? One is a UN directory for the commissioner for human rights, and one is an **Israeli** professor of Holocaust and genocide studies. Please clarify why they're controversial.

To clarify my position, prior to reading Mokhiber's statement, Raz Segal's writing and video, I did not believe Israel's actions met the threshold for genocide. Personally, my opinion has changed as I believe they present a strong case to the legal definitions.
Lol it’s not hyperbole it’s facts, if you just look it up. Of course, you won’t because you’re brainwashed by propaganda. Come back with actual evidence, your words don’t mean shit. 

Running around calling people terrorists also don’t mean shit because I’m not lol. Who the fuck are you to tell me who I am. If you are Islamophobic that’s obviously not fine, but it’s clear that Palestinian lives don’t matter to you since you’re racist.
>It took ONE MONTH for the Israelis to kill that many Palestinians.

Again, so what? It took the US 2 days to kill more people in Tokyo than have been killed across the entire Arab-Israeli conflicts.

Does this whole thing become so much more moral if Israel draws the war out over a year rather than a month? If anything, it's better for everyone to end Hamas quickly.

>Do I need to spell out for you that U.S.-led coalitian forces fought a war against an army of 375,000 troops? In heavily populated, dense urban areas? Do you recall that the First Battle of Fallujah was in 2004? Remember, that was included in the IBC query we just did together a moment ago.

That wasn't fought against the Iraqi army.  The Iraqi Army during 2003 was not heavily encamped with civilians which is why civilian casualties were so low.

This btw is true in other places. Relatively few Ukranian civilians have died (even though Russia isn't particularly considerate of them) because the Ukranian military doesn't intermix with civilians.

>No, its an astonishingly high casualty rate that is inexcusable in modern conflict. And the perpetrators are war criminals by legal definition.

Propose an alternative, *viable* method of destroying Hamas.

Note that the US basically lost in both Afghanistan and Iraq, so I don't consider its methods viable.

Sri Lanka actually ended [Tamil terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%932009_Sri_Lankan_Army_Northern_offensive), at the cost of 50k lives.
You haven't clarified shit. What am I implying?
Okay? No sources are backing your claims. I'm not sure what ""Netenyahu"" (sic) has to do with it.
Someone let their boomer, racist uncle make a Reddit account.
I didn't ask you for anything.
Prove me wrong.


You, on the other hand, are most likely the blue haired one.

Edit: I was wrong. Not sure about Pakistani for you, though. Afghani? But definitely in the indoctrination camp, that's obvious.
I don't need to listen to every crank (I'd go through the video if there were a transcript though). Does he make a clear argument why Dresden is not a genocide? Again, I'm not seeing it in the first few minutes.  His long [writings](https://jewishcurrents.org/a-textbook-case-of-genocide) simply don't engage with the counter-arguments.

>One is a UN directory for the commissioner for human rights

Yah, the UN isn't some impartial organization.  Can't even bother to condemn the October 7 massacres.

>one is an Israeli professor of Holocaust and genocide studies.

Wow, I can find [Palestinians](https://twitter.com/RichardHanania/status/1727888043468898350) living in America that support bombing Gaza. What's your point? Doesn't make any of them correct.  Why are they more correct than Kierman? His thought process seems much more cogent.

>Personally, my opinion has changed as I believe they present a strong case to the legal definitions.

You haven't created a coherent case (nor have they) why Dresden is NOT a genocide if this is.
You're making this discussion pretty insufferable. I make every good faith effort to cite respected sources, then you just reply with lies and disingenuous comparisons. I'll just preface this that I will not continue this discussion unless you make some effort to back your claims and not outright lie.

\> That wasn't fought against the Iraqi army. The Iraqi Army during 2003 was not heavily encamped with civilians which is why civilian casualties were so low.

\> Note that the US basically lost in both Afghanistan and Iraq, so I don't consider its methods viable.

I don't fear Al Qaeda terrorist attacks anymore. Do you? I don't fear ISIS/ISIL terrorist attacks anymore. Do you? Saddam isn't dropping sarin gas on the Kurds anymore, is he?

The fact is that [Israel has been committing war crimes and atrocities against the Palestinians for 70 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_war_crimes), yet they still live in fear of terror attacks. It sure seems like one strategy is more effective than the other.

\> Again, so what? It took the US 2 days to kill more people in Tokyo than have been killed across the entire Arab-Israeli conflicts.

I fail to see your point here. Is your goal to justify morally or legally the use of nukes against Hamas and, by proximity, Palestinians? What do you aim to gain by comparing the Israel-Palestine conflict to the largest global conflict between every major world superpower that encompassed the worst crimes against humanity ever committed?

\> If anything, it's better for everyone to end Hamas quickly.

You're either terribly shortsighted or dishonest if you cannot understand why crimes against humanity are named that for a reason. Humanity as a whole is worse off by Israel's actions, particularly if we do not hold them responsible for their crimes. If we make it clear that we excuse war crimes, it becomes in every state's best interest to drop white phosphorus directly on your house the moment a conflict begins.
The Gaza health ministry has been a reliable source of casualty statistics for over 20 years for every international organization, and they’ve  backed the sources I’ve already sent. To get the percent statistics, you take the raw number statistics… for which I’ve already provided sources… and divide. How did you get into Berkeley again?
I was trying to see if I could bait him into saying the actual slur so I could report him
Quiet down and take the L bud
Behold, legitimate grievances.

Israel has: for years destabilized the region, contributed to the invasion of Iraq, continually interferes in U.S. politics, is a resource sink of tax payer dollars that CAN and SHOULD be spent on our own(I believe this of all foreign aid), years of violence and complicit support of settlers in the West Bank

I could go on but I’d bet my bottom dollar that just off these you’re gonna start ignoring things, calling me antisemitic, or some other crap.

Edit: Lol, calling me a blue hair is ironic as fuck
\> Iraqi army human shields

Alright, I concede this happened.  It looks like what [happened](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB222.html) to help the US-allied forces is poor morale and lack of preparation for guerrilla conflict, neither of which is true with Hamas.  Battles in general were not in heavily [civilian areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq#), which ultimately came down to Iraqi infrastructure existing throughout a large country rather than being concentrated in urban areas as in Gaza.  And in general, [Iraqis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Basra_(2003))seemed to have surrendered much more readily than Hamas and tended to not be so heavily in civilian areas.

>I don't fear Al Qaeda terrorist attacks anymore. Do you? I don't fear ISIS/ISIL terrorist attacks anymore

The Taliban still runs Afghanistan. I didnt' fear Al Qaeda by 2002 realistically. And ISIS only become a force to begin with because of the power vacuum left over from Saddam's overthrow.

>The fact is that Israel has been committing war crimes and atrocities against the Palestinians for 70 years, yet they still live in fear of terror attacks

The terror attacks [rose heavily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Palestinian_suicide_attacks) while they were making honest peace attempts with the Palestinians.  Suicide attacks went from minimal to 4 per year after the Oslo Accords were signed.  The Second Intifada started only after the most aggressive attempt at peace.  I won't even get to the PA's constant refusal to sign peace agreements and the fact that Hamas is obviously much more extreme.

Not a good sign for peace, which is why the Israeli public has shifted so heavily rightward.  Attacks actually dwindled to near zero after the last sincere attempt at peace (2008), which again is why the right wing has been so electorally successful. (Obviously, 10/7/23 broke that pattern).

>Humanity as a whole is worse off by Israel's actions, particularly if we do not hold them responsible for their crimes.

The incentives created by a strong demand to protect civilian lives unfortunately give terrorist groups enormous leverage, especially when the world is unwilling to crack down on said groups.  

Sri Lanka had the same problem with the LTTE -- I recall years ago hearing from liberal teachers the military solution wouldn't solve the underlying problems and thus was hopeless.  I don't know if the underlying problems were solved or not but clearly Tamil terrorism is no longer a thing.
Your sources don't back the claims you've made, even citing the Ministry. You haven't linked ""raw number statistics"" nor is it clear what ""and divide"" would mean in this context. Divide by what? Please articulate an argument.   
You made very bold claims and have not backed them yet.
Did you get a severe TBI while you were deployed? You seem to be delusional and have reading comprehension issues.

Let me be abundantly clear. I never asked you a question and haven't read anything you've written. Go back to trolling someone else.
See, unlike you, I already admitted I was wrong and edited my post before you even responded. Definitely not a blue hair and clearly in the indoctrinated upbringing category.
Look man, yes Iraq and Gaza aren't literally the same. Afghanistan and Gaza aren't literally the same. There will never be a 1:1 comparison, but its the best we have and its pretty damn close. I will agree that Hamas are entrenched in a particularly dense urban area. And if the casualty rates of civilians were 2-5x higher than what we saw 2001-2010, we could discuss seriously whether the policy is productive or not. But we see 24x (Iraq) and 33x (Afghanistan) higher casualty rates of civilians (citing previous sources). The rate is just outrageous and unfathomable by contemporary counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency standards. I've proven that to you with numbers from multiple reputable sources. I wish I could help you see that but I don't know how? Its so outrageous its criminal, and instead of having discussions about counter-insurgency strategy we are having discussions about war crimes and genocide.

What proof would you need to see to concede that the IDF and the state of Israel are perpetrating war crimes? What meets the threshold of too far for you? No cop out answers like nuclear weapons, please.
You didn’t edit it, if it makes you feel better to say you did then fine though. My end showed that and that alone.

And indoctrinated upbringing? 😂

My family left because of that. Stop grasping at straws, it makes you look childish.
So I'm right?

>Dear Esteemed Chair, Prof. Dr. Tomlin,  
>  
>I trust this missive finds you in good health and high spirits. I am extending my hand of communication as a product and one-time employee of the distinguished EECS Department, with regard to an incident that transpired, if my calculations serve me right, nearly two months prior.  
>  
>This particular circumstance pertains to my former colleague, Lecturer Peyrin Kao, whom I understand delivered a discourse related to the current scenario in Western Asia. Reports have come to my attention that this address was adjudged political and, subsequently, unsuitable, leading to a rather public announcement disseminated amongst the course's participants. Further hearsay suggests deliberations regarding Lecturer Kao’s potential dismissal within the administrative circles of the EECS Department are underway.  
>  
>It is paramount to mention that my respective affiliations to the department have since lapsed, consequently, the aforementioned information reaching me has been largely via the grapevine of social media platforms.  
>  
>Given my understanding of the situation intrinsically marred or enhanced, depending on perspective, by the potentially fallible nature of rumours, let me expressly articulate that my standpoint resonates wholly with that of the department's. I am of the school of thought that lecture halls, irrespective of the contextual disclaimers made, are unsuitable for political discourse.  
>  
>Consequently, I editorially accept the prospect of disciplinary actions potentially meted out, underlining the ethos of maintaining an educational environment free from potentially disruptive or controversial statements.

>However, I must admit, my queries are more related to the prior instances of a similar nature that I've had the opportunity to witness firsthand. Given the relatability of these incidents, I harbour considerable curiosity about the department's standards in such matters.  
>  
>In the Autumn of 2022, during the final segment of the initial lecture of CS 194-026, Prof. Dr. Efros veered onto a rather political tangent, expressing his support for Ukraine and his disapproval of Putin’s incursion into the said nation. The absence of a pre-existing notification regarding this segment of his speech being optional for attendees brings up the question – could the address by Prof. Dr. Efros be considered in similar context to that of Lecturer Kao?  
>  
>In the Spring season of 2021, during a lecture of CS 161, Dr. Weaver expressed a vehement disapproval towards the Iranian government's measures curbing internet security. Would the remarks made by him be deemed as an inappropriate political sentiment akin to those uttered by Lecturer Kao?  
>  
>Concerning an honourable professor in the Department who once served in the IDF - is his prominent display of the state of Israel's flag outside his office considered of similar nature and warranted equivalent investigation or action as that concerning Lecturer Kao?   
>  
>To clarify, my query is not the statements *per se*, as I, as a matter of fact, support a subset of them, nor the eventual resolution of these incidents, but rather the threshold applied by the Department. Were these speeches, political in nature, elevated as those of Lecturer Kao? Is this a standard that nullifies all political speeches made in an instructional environment, or is it nuanced depending on the level of discomfort felt by certain individuals or on the occasions when there is a lack of alignment with the Department's viewpoint?

Verily, sir, your email does suggest a most introspective and even-handed inquiry into this matter regarding the discourse as proffered forth by Peyrin Kao. Particularly insofar as it parallels other discursions by elstwhile faculty in their respective courses.

However, summarily I have to observate that except perchance speculation by reddit users, we have received no indications that Lecturer Kao has faced any repercussions and yet months later, he has begunt the first lecture of the new 61B semester.

It’s a trap.
IDK why we have a compulsion to dilute the meaning of already bad things. Military occupation of the West Bank + illegal settlements is already super bad, but it's not apartheid. Also, why do I get the feeling that they're not only referring to the West Bank when talking about apartheid.

You could, yet you people still choose to harass Jewish students that have nothing to do with what is happening in Gaza. You have gone from civil disobedience to outright irrational hatred.

But you know more than HRW, Amnesty international, and the UN
apartheid includes racial segregation and discrimination, unequal opportunities. occupation and illegal settlements aren’t always apartheid but in the palestinian case it is. the streets in west bank are segregated - there are a lot of other examples. the IDF is enforcing such discrimination. i don’t know what else to tell you. look it up yourself

depends on how production is organized in society via a socio-economic systems - particularly which class that production serves. in times that production and its machinery serves a small percentage i agree with your sentiment, that is largely the case, but not always the case, production and technology can create the conditions to allow humans to have more free time to ponder and change the world, invest in education instead of an economic elite.
antizionism does not equal antisemitism my friend
Just because I call you a murderer doesn't mean anything unless we go through a legal process to prove it. Literally none of those reports are legally binding, and there has never been any legally binding document/act that declares Israel an apartheid state.

And I can refer to organizations too. Neither the US nor the European Commission ([https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-9-2022-000932-ASW\_EN.html](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-9-2022-000932-ASW_EN.html)) considers what Israel is doing apartheid. 

In this case, it's not a matter of whether I know more than the Human Rights Orgs and the UN, it's about what actions are being done to improve the plight of the Palestinians, and calling Israel an apartheid state does negative to help the Palestinian cause.

Also, slamming hundreds of pages down is lazy as fuck lol. I know you didn't read past the headline of those reports.
Apartheid also requires intent and needs to be inflicted on your own citizens. Palestinians in the West Bank don't belong to Israel so this doesn't apply. 

I'm actually 50/50 on Area C being apartheid, but we can skip that entire debate because we already have terms that accurately and undeniably describe what Israel is doing. Calling Israel an apartheid state moves us no closer to improving the situation for Palestinians, in fact, all it does is cause a rally around the flag phenomenon that gives the extreme right more ammunition. 

And yeah, if this is the extent of your knowledge on this topic, of course you don’t know what else to tell me.
Better yet, you could just tell me and show me how you're wrong
Take your IDF money elsewhere troll
1. if you say the argument is that this is not happening to its own citizens, take a look at this “[citizenship rights pyramid](https://palestinetoday.quora.com/The-Apartheid-Pyramid?ch=15&oid=14272596&share=d8b688fc&target_type=post https://palestinetoday.quora.com/The-Apartheid-Pyramid?ch=15&oid=14272596&share=d8b688fc&target_type=post)”. i’d ask you to define “intent” here. does this “intent” somehow also extend to surrounding areas that are not under israeli rule? the west bank technically doesn’t belong to israel, but why are there so many IDF soldiers there? what are they doing? amnesty international and many other agencies have classified israel as an apartheid state. you clearly understand the human rights violation going on, so it’s funny that you think it’s not an apartheid state. it’s like you know more about the semantics and definition of apartheid. october 7 didn’t “happen in a vacuum”.
2. i don’t give two shits about what the extreme right is going to do about this. they can, will and have already taken whatever they want as ammunition. i have no control over them. should i restrict speech in case whatever i say is taken out of context and ammunized against me? btw the left have also done this. this issue extends beyond the political spectrum. 
3. an ad hominem attack? that’s low. i’ve been to occupied west bank. i’ve seen it for myself. i’ve learnt the history of the state. i see the videos pouring out from “both sides”. it’s not my job to educate you. i don’t need to explain why israel is an apartheid state to you. want to learn more? there’s even a decal at berkeley. and there are so many teach ins.
Yeah, it's so much easier to live in a world where disagreement with your ignorance is a result of Jew money, rather than the fact you're a lazy virtue signaler. Can't believe I went to the same school as you.

Although tbh, I'd prefer to be commenting because of Sorosbux and not because I see dumb shit pop up in my feed, so can't say I don't empathize with you :(
1. if you say the argument is that this is not happening to its own citizens, take a look at this “citizenship rights pyramid”.

\---All that pyramid says is that Israel doesn't have open borders. Hamas is responsible for Palestinians in Gaza and the Palestinian authority has civil control of Areas A and B. None of those areas belong to Israel and Israel has as much legal responsibility for them as India does for American citizens. And I like how it doesn't give any evidence for Israeli Arabs being less than Israeli Jews.

1. i’d ask you to define “intent” here. does this “intent” somehow also extend to surrounding areas that are not under israeli rule? the west bank technically doesn’t belong to israel, but why are there so many IDF soldiers there? what are they doing?

\---As for intent, the intent of the Israelis may not be racially based considering they don't treat Arab Israelis anywhere near as badly. It's more to do with security, considering they were attacked multiple times and had to deal with a crapload of terrorism. There's a crapload of IDF in the West Bank to decrease the amount of terrorism coming from it (Gaza had no IDF occupation after 2005, look what happened then).

1. amnesty international and many other agencies have classified israel as an apartheid state.

\---Sure, Amnesty, HRW, and others classified Israel as an apartheid state, but that doesn't mean anything because none of those reports are legally binding. I can call you a murderer, but that doesn't mean anything officially unless we get some legal authority to weigh in. If you want to play this game, I can say both the US and European Commission disagree with Israel being an apartheid state.

1. you clearly understand the human rights violation going on, so it’s funny that you think it’s not an apartheid state. it’s like you know more about the semantics and definition of apartheid. october 7 didn’t “happen in a vacuum”.

\---Bruh, we're literally talking about law here, the semantics and definitions are important. And wtf do you mean by october 7 didn’t “happen in a vacuum”?

2. i don’t give two shits about what the extreme right is going to do about this. they can, will and have already taken whatever they want as ammunition. i have no control over them. should i restrict speech in case whatever i say is taken out of context and ammunized against me? btw the left have also done this. this issue extends beyond the political spectrum.

\---I didn't think I'd need to explain this to a Berkeley student, but if you care about Palestinians more than virtue signaling you should very much care about what Israelis think. Unless you're thinking the ultimate solution is to eliminate all the Jews, for all practical purposes the thoughts of the Israelis need to be kept in mind. For example, Israelis generally supported negotiation   throughout the 90s, but any prospect of the two state solution died after the 2nd Intifada because Israelis got blackpilled on peace so they resorted to occupation instead. Which is really fucking sad, because Israel was close to giving Arafat (may he rest in piss) a deal that would 've been unimaginably good today. And just in general, it's a good idea to understand you enemy.

3. an ad hominem attack? that’s low.

\---You questioned my understanding first lol. What else does "" i don’t know what else to tell you. look it up yourself"" mean?

3.  i’ve been to occupied west bank. i’ve seen it for myself. i’ve learnt the history of the state. i see the videos pouring out from “both sides”. it’s not my job to educate you. i don’t need to explain why israel is an apartheid state to you. want to learn more? there’s even a decal at berkeley. and there are so many teach ins.

\---Bruh, you didn't know Israel's security rationale for occupying the West Bank, you don't know how international law works, you know nothing about successful tactics to fight oppression, and your pyramid was honestly some dumb shit.  Don't call yourself educated on a topic if you basically only get your information from one side. In terms of getting closer to a just outcome for Palestinians, you're literally no better than the far right Israelis we both despise."

https://rankings.thefire.org/rank Berkeley is actually pretty mid for free speech. Like as an individual if you want to speak out about an issue, the admin is more likely to call you out and punish than at say, Texas A&M. But the students/faculty are more politically active at Berkeley than say A&M
We’re seeing this happen everywhere (actors are being fired for speaking up against Israel). Idk the man but it takes a backbone and humanity to do what he did. He was so calm about it too. These are the profs we need at Berkeley.
To be honest, if your professor said class was over and you can leave but said he will be saying something I don’t think you would leave because fomo. I know I wouldn’t. Maybe if he prefaced it by saying what he would talk about so people know

The lecture was explicitly over; he said everybody was free to leave, and that no more course content would be covered. By your logic, any personal expression while being employed by a government agency is “using state funds for said talk”.

He ended the class early then proceeded to use the university resources which was paid for by tuition. If he simply said lecture over and let’s talk outside for those interested he’d be fine
It was during class time in the same lecture hall in front of the same students. The fact that the only argument against this being completely inappropriate is that he declared the lecture was over says a lot about the issue. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the only untrue thing Peyrin said during his monologue. He was consciously in explicit violation of UC policies and should be fired.
Um… she said western media only shows the Israeli side. Saying that she claimed Jews control the media is outright libel. This is ridiculous
getting “jews manipulate the narrative and memory of the holocaust” from what she actually said:  “western media only shows the other side” is INSANE
Tell me you lack comprehension without telling me you lack comprehension. Airhead ass.
Dude where did you get this information? Stop twisting her words.
Ok but how does this affect Lebron’s legacy?
If you really think the *location* of the discussion makes an ethical difference, or even relates to tuition whatsoever, then there is no point arguing with you.
It’s called title IV, and look up teacher policy. This will be used in the lawsuit against Berkeley to show a title IV violation with ramification of defunding the university. 

Hence the university’s actions. If you don’t like this change the law and policy
You’re actually wrong, it’s not part of Title IV, hence why you didn’t cite any specific code or judicial precedent. You *can* throw around these terms, and you *can* expect them to support a retarded non-argument, but you can’t make a logical progression that way. Cite your sources, support your claim."

Spring is the on-season for 61B, so usually 1500+ students sign up for the class, so that would be crazy if a Prof wasn’t found. Believe it or not, the last Prof to teach 61B in a regular semester not named Hug or Hilfinger was….Prof Shewchuk in 2014.  Profs Canny and Garcia have also taught this class in ancient times.
i heard they’re hiring some stanford prof but that’s just through the grapevine. source: am in circles w course staff
Who’s teaching 61c in spring?
I know and believe that they should offer 61B eventually. The only thing that disturbs me is the unstableness of draft schedule due to quite a few changes.
I believe he is going to teach the probability portion, which isn’t very surprising if he’s going to formulate that part according to his DS 100 handouts
You are exactly hitting everything that I would like to say or cover! Prof. Shewchuk is the best guess I have since he taught the course most recently and frequently at the same time. However, he has 189/289 to manage for Sp23, which is where most of us hear his name from initially.
And I am feeling that Dan is also kind of possible to teach the class. Although 61C is a large course to manage, the department should have its size shrunk during Sp23, which might make Dan potentially available to teach 61B (though it’s still a wild guess for some degree)
I have some vague image that someone mentioned this on Reddit (actually is that you originally?) and I believe you’re talking about Prof. Lisa Yan? She’s already teaching DS 100 and assigned to 61C for Fa22.
According to draft schedule, Dan and Peyrin Kao.
yeah that was me, this is someone else though
nope, wasn’t me, and nope, would be a new prof i think"
